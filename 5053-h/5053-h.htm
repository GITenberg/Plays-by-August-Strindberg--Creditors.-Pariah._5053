    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is one of the three plays which Strindberg placed at the head of his
      dramatic production during the middle ultra-naturalistic period, the other
      two being "The Father" and "Miss Julia." It is, in many ways, one of the
      strongest he ever produced. Its rarely excelled unity of construction, its
      tremendous dramatic tension, and its wonderful psychological analysis
      combine to make it a masterpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Swedish its name is "Fordringsagare." This indefinite form may be
      either singular or plural, but it is rarely used except as a plural. And
      the play itself makes it perfectly clear that the proper translation of
      its title is "Creditors," for under this aspect appear both the former and
      the present husband of Tekla. One of the main objects of the play is to
      reveal her indebtedness first to one and then to the other of these men,
      while all the time she is posing as a person of original gifts.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have little doubt that Strindberg, at the time he wrote this play&mdash;and
      bear in mind that this happened only a year before he finally decided to
      free himself from an impossible marriage by an appeal to the law&mdash;believed
      Tekla to be fairly representative of womanhood in general. The utter
      unreasonableness of such a view need hardly be pointed out, and I shall
      waste no time on it. A question more worthy of discussion is whether the
      figure of Tekla be true to life merely as the picture of a personality&mdash;as
      one out of numerous imaginable variations on a type decided not by sex but
      by faculties and qualities. And the same question may well be raised in
      regard to the two men, both of whom are evidently intended to win our
      sympathy: one as the victim of a fate stronger than himself, and the other
      as the conqueror of adverse and humiliating circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personally, I am inclined to doubt whether a Tekla can be found in the
      flesh&mdash;and even if found, she might seem too exceptional to gain
      acceptance as a real individuality. It must be remembered, however, that,
      in spite of his avowed realism, Strindberg did not draw his men and women
      in the spirit generally designated as impressionistic; that is, with the
      idea that they might step straight from his pages into life and there win
      recognition as human beings of familiar aspect. His realism is always
      mixed with idealism; his figures are always "doctored," so to speak. And
      they have been thus treated in order to enable their creator to drive home
      the particular truth he is just then concerned with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consciously or unconsciously he sought to produce what may be designated
      as "pure cultures" of certain human qualities. But these he took great
      pains to arrange in their proper psychological settings, for mental and
      moral qualities, like everything else, run in groups that are more or less
      harmonious, if not exactly homogeneous. The man with a single quality,
      like Moliere's Harpagon, was much too primitive and crude for Strindberg's
      art, as he himself rightly asserted in his preface to "Miss Julia." When
      he wanted to draw the genius of greed, so to speak, he did it by setting
      it in the midst of related qualities of a kind most likely to be attracted
      by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tekla is such a "pure culture" of a group of naturally correlated mental
      and moral qualities and functions and tendencies&mdash;of a personality
      built up logically around a dominant central note. There are within all of
      us many personalities, some of which remain for ever potentialities. But
      it is conceivable that any one of them, under circumstances different from
      those in which we have been living, might have developed into its severely
      logical consequence&mdash;or, if you please, into a human being that would
      be held abnormal if actually encountered.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is exactly what Strindberg seems to have done time and again, both in
      his middle and final periods, in his novels as well as in his plays. In
      all of us a Tekla, an Adolph, a Gustav&mdash;or a Jean and a Miss Julia&mdash;lie
      more or less dormant. And if we search our souls unsparingly, I fear the
      result can only be an admission that&mdash;had the needed set of
      circumstances been provided&mdash;we might have come unpleasantly close to
      one of those Strindbergian creatures which we are now inclined to reject
      as unhuman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we have the secret of what I believe to be the great Swedish
      dramatist's strongest hold on our interest. How could it otherwise happen
      that so many critics, of such widely differing temperaments, have recorded
      identical feelings as springing from a study of his work: on one side an
      active resentment, a keen unwillingness to be interested; on the other, an
      attraction that would not be denied in spite of resolute resistance to it!
      For Strindberg DOES hold us, even when we regret his power of doing so.
      And no one familiar with the conclusions of modern psychology could
      imagine such a paradox possible did not the object of our sorely divided
      feelings provide us with something that our minds instinctively recognise
      as true to life in some way, and for that reason valuable to the art of
      living.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are so many ways of presenting truth. Strindberg's is only one of
      them&mdash;and not the one commonly employed nowadays. Its main fault lies
      perhaps in being too intellectual, too abstract. For while Strindberg was
      intensely emotional, and while this fact colours all his writings, he
      could only express himself through his reason. An emotion that would move
      another man to murder would precipitate Strindberg into merciless analysis
      of his own or somebody else's mental and moral make-up. At any rate, I do
      not proclaim his way of presenting truth as the best one of all available.
      But I suspect that this decidedly strange way of Strindberg's&mdash;resulting
      in such repulsively superior beings as Gustav, or in such grievously
      inferior ones as Adolph&mdash;may come nearer the temper and needs of the
      future than do the ways of much more plausible writers. This does not need
      to imply that the future will imitate Strindberg. But it may ascertain
      what he aimed at doing, and then do it with a degree of perfection which
      he, the pioneer, could never hope to attain.

    <h2>
      SCENE
    </h2>
    <p>
      (A parlor in a summer hotel on the sea-shore. The rear wall has a door
      opening on a veranda, beyond which is seen a landscape. To the right of
      the door stands a table with newspapers on it. There is a chair on the
      left side of the stage. To the right of the table stands a sofa. A door on
      the right leads to an adjoining room.)
    </p>
    <p>
      (ADOLPH and GUSTAV, the latter seated on the sofa by the table to the
      right.)
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [At work on a wax figure on a miniature modelling stand; his
      crutches are placed beside him]&mdash;and for all this I have to thank
      you!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. [Smoking a cigar] Oh, nonsense!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Why, certainly! During the first days after my wife had gone, I
      lay helpless on a sofa and did nothing but long for her. It was as if she
      had taken away my crutches with her, so that I couldn't move from the
      spot. When I had slept a couple of days, I seemed to come to, and began to
      pull myself together. My head calmed down after having been working
      feverishly. Old thoughts from days gone by bobbed up again. The desire to
      work and the instinct for creation came back. My eyes recovered their
      faculty of quick and straight vision&mdash;and then you showed up.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. I admit you were in a miserable condition when I first met you,
      and you had to use your crutches when you walked, but this is not to say
      that my presence has been the cause of your recovery. You needed a rest,
      and you had a craving for masculine company.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Oh, that's true enough, like everything you say. Once I used to
      have men for friends, but I thought them superfluous after I married, and
      I felt quite satisfied with the one I had chosen. Later I was drawn into
      new circles and made a lot of acquaintances, but my wife was jealous of
      them&mdash;she wanted to keep me to herself: worse still&mdash;she wanted
      also to keep my friends to herself. And so I was left alone with my own
      jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Yes, you have a strong tendency toward that kind of disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. I was afraid of losing her&mdash;and I tried to prevent it. There
      is nothing strange in that. But I was never afraid that she might be
      deceiving me&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. No, that's what married men are never afraid of.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Yes, isn't it queer? What I really feared was that her friends
      would get such an influence over her that they would begin to exercise
      some kind of indirect power over me&mdash;and THAT is something I couldn't
      bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. So your ideas don't agree&mdash;yours and your wife's?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Seeing that you have heard so much already, I may as well tell you
      everything. My wife has an independent nature&mdash;what are you smiling
      at?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Go on! She has an independent nature&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Which cannot accept anything from me&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. But from everybody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [After a pause] Yes.&mdash;And it looked as if she especially
      hated my ideas because they were mine, and not because there was anything
      wrong about them. For it used to happen quite often that she advanced
      ideas that had once been mine, and that she stood up for them as her own.
      Yes, it even happened that friends of mine gave her ideas which they had
      taken directly from me, and then they seemed all right. Everything was all
      right except what came from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Which means that you are not entirely happy?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Oh yes, I am happy. I have the one I wanted, and I have never
      wanted anybody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. And you have never wanted to be free?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. No, I can't say that I have. Oh, well, sometimes I have imagined
      that it might seem like a rest to be free. But the moment she leaves me, I
      begin to long for her&mdash;long for her as for my own arms and legs. It
      is queer that sometimes I have a feeling that she is nothing in herself,
      but only a part of myself&mdash;an organ that can take away with it my
      will, my very desire to live. It seems almost as if I had deposited with
      her that centre of vitality of which the anatomical books tell us.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Perhaps, when we get to the bottom of it, that is just what has
      happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. How could it be so? Is she not an independent being, with thoughts
      of her own? And when I met her I was nothing&mdash;a child of an artist
      whom she undertook to educate.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. But later you developed her thoughts and educated her, didn't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. No, she stopped growing and I pushed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Yes, isn't it strange that her "authoring" seemed to fall off
      after her first book&mdash;or that it failed to improve, at least? But
      that first time she had a subject which wrote itself&mdash;for I
      understand she used her former husband for a model. You never knew him,
      did you? They say he was an idiot.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. I never knew him, as he was away for six months at a time. But he
      must have been an arch-idiot, judging by her picture of him. [Pause] And
      you may feel sure that the picture was correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. I do!&mdash;But why did she ever take him?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Because she didn't know him well enough. Of course, you never DO
      get acquainted until afterward!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. And for that reason one ought not to marry until&mdash;afterward.&mdash;And
      he was a tyrant, of course?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Of course?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Why, so are all married men. [Feeling his way] And you not the
      least.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. I? Who let my wife come and go as she pleases&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Well, that's nothing. You couldn't lock her up, could you? But do
      you like her to stay away whole nights?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. No, really, I don't.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. There, you see! [With a change of tactics] And to tell the truth,
      it would only make you ridiculous to like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Ridiculous? Can a man be ridiculous because he trusts his wife?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Of course he can. And it's just what you are already&mdash;and
      thoroughly at that!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Convulsively] I! It's what I dread most of all&mdash;and there's
      going to be a change.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Don't get excited now&mdash;or you'll have another attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. But why isn't she ridiculous when I stay out all night?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Yes, why? Well, it's nothing that concerns you, but that's the way
      it is. And while you are trying to figure out why, the mishap has already
      occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. What mishap?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. However, the first husband was a tyrant, and she took him only to
      get her freedom. You see, a girl cannot have freedom except by providing
      herself with a chaperon&mdash;or what we call a husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Of course not.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. And now you are the chaperon.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. I?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Since you are her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      (ADOLPH keeps a preoccupied silence.)
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Am I not right?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Uneasily] I don't know. You live with a woman for years, and you
      never stop to analyse her, or your relationship with her, and then&mdash;then
      you begin to think&mdash;and there you are!&mdash;Gustav, you are my
      friend. The only male friend I have. During this last week you have given
      me courage to live again. It is as if your own magnetism had been poured
      into me. Like a watchmaker, you have fixed the works in my head and wound
      up the spring again. Can't you hear, yourself, how I think more clearly
      and speak more to the point? And to myself at least it seems as if my
      voice had recovered its ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. So it seems to me also. And why is that?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. I shouldn't wonder if you grew accustomed to lower your voice in
      talking to women. I know at least that Tekla always used to accuse me of
      shouting.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. And so you toned down your voice and accepted the rule of the
      slipper?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. That isn't quite the way to put it. [After some reflection] I
      think it is even worse than that. But let us talk of something else!&mdash;What
      was I saying?&mdash;Yes, you came here, and you enabled me to see my art
      in its true light. Of course, for some time I had noticed my growing lack
      of interest in painting, as it didn't seem to offer me the proper medium
      for the expression of what I wanted to bring out. But when you explained
      all this to me, and made it clear why painting must fail as a timely
      outlet for the creative instinct, then I saw the light at last&mdash;and I
      realised that hereafter it would not be possible for me to express myself
      by means of colour only.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Are you quite sure now that you cannot go on painting&mdash;that
      you may not have a relapse?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Perfectly sure! For I have tested myself. When I went to bed that
      night after our talk, I rehearsed your argument point by point, and I knew
      you had it right. But when I woke up from a good night's sleep and my head
      was clear again, then it came over me in a flash that you might be
      mistaken after all. And I jumped out of bed and got hold of my brushes and
      paints&mdash;but it was no use! Every trace of illusion was gone&mdash;it
      was nothing but smears of paint, and I quaked at the thought of having
      believed, and having made others believe, that a painted canvas could be
      anything but a painted canvas. The veil had fallen from my eyes, and it
      was just as impossible for me to paint any more as it was to become a
      child again.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. And then you saw that the realistic tendency of our day, its
      craving for actuality and tangibility, could only find its proper form in
      sculpture, which gives you body, extension in all three dimensions&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Vaguely] The three dimensions&mdash;oh yes, body, in a word!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. And then you became a sculptor yourself. Or rather, you have been
      one all your life, but you had gone astray, and nothing was needed but a
      guide to put you on the right road&mdash;Tell me, do you experience
      supreme joy now when you are at work?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Now I am living!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. May I see what you are doing?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. A female figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Without a model? And so lifelike at that!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Apathetically] Yes, but it resembles somebody. It is remarkable
      that this woman seems to have become a part of my body as I of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Well, that's not so very remarkable. Do you know what transfusion
      is?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Of blood? Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. And you seem to have bled yourself a little too much. When I look
      at the figure here I comprehend several things which I merely guessed
      before. You have loved her tremendously!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Yes, to such an extent that I couldn't tell whether she was I or I
      she. When she is smiling, I smile also. When she is weeping, I weep. And
      when she&mdash;can you imagine anything like it?&mdash;when she was giving
      life to our child&mdash;I felt the birth pangs within myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Do you know, my dear friend&mdash;I hate to speak of it, but you
      are already showing the first symptoms of epilepsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Agitated] I! How can you tell?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Because I have watched the symptoms in a younger brother of mine
      who had been worshipping Venus a little too excessively.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. How&mdash;how did it show itself&mdash;that thing you spoke of?
    </p>
    <p>
      [During the following passage GUSTAV speaks with great animation, and
      ADOLPH listens so intently that, unconsciously, he imitates many of
      GUSTAV'S gestures.]
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. It was dreadful to witness, and if you don't feel strong enough I
      won't inflict a description of it on you.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Nervously] Yes, go right on&mdash;just go on!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Well, the boy happened to marry an innocent little creature with
      curls, and eyes like a turtle-dove; with the face of a child and the pure
      soul of an angel. But nevertheless she managed to usurp the male
      prerogative&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. What is that?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Initiative, of course. And with the result that the angel nearly
      carried him off to heaven. But first he had to be put on the cross and
      made to feel the nails in his flesh. It was horrible!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Breathlessly] Well, what happened?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. [Lingering on each word] We might be sitting together talking, he
      and I&mdash;and when I had been speaking for a while his face would turn
      white as chalk, his arms and legs would grow stiff, and his thumbs became
      twisted against the palms of his hands&mdash;like this. [He illustrates
      the movement and it is imitated by ADOLPH] Then his eyes became bloodshot,
      and he began to chew&mdash;like this. [He chews, and again ADOLPH imitates
      him] The saliva was rattling in his throat. His chest was squeezed
      together as if it had been closed in a vice. The pupils of his eyes
      flickered like gas-jets. His tongue beat the saliva into a lather, and he
      sank&mdash;slowly&mdash;down&mdash;backward&mdash;into the chair&mdash;as
      if he were drowning. And then&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [In a whisper] Stop now!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. And then&mdash;Are you not feeling well?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. [Gets a glass of water for him] There: drink now. And we'll talk
      of something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Feebly] Thank you! Please go on!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Well&mdash;when he came to he couldn't remember anything at all.
      He had simply lost consciousness. Has that ever happened to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Yes, I have had attacks of vertigo now and then, but my physician
      says it's only anaemia.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Well, that's the beginning of it, you know. But, believe me, it
      will end in epilepsy if you don't take care of yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. What can I do?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. To begin with, you will have to observe complete abstinence.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. For how long?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. For half a year at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. I cannot do it. That would upset our married life.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Good-bye to you then!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Covers up the wax figure] I cannot do it!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Can you not save your own life?&mdash;But tell me, as you have
      already given me so much of your confidence&mdash;is there no other
      canker, no secret wound, that troubles you? For it is very rare to find
      only one cause of discord, as life is so full of variety and so fruitful
      in chances for false relationships. Is there not a corpse in your cargo
      that you are trying to hide from yourself?&mdash;For instance, you said a
      minute ago that you have a child which has been left in other people's
      care. Why don't you keep it with you?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. My wife doesn't want us to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. And her reason? Speak up now!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Because, when it was about three years old, it began to look like
      him, her former husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Well? Have you seen her former husband?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. No, never. I have only had a casual glance at a very poor portrait
      of him, and then I couldn't detect the slightest resemblance.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Oh, portraits are never like the original, and, besides, he might
      have changed considerably since it was made. However, I hope it hasn't
      aroused any suspicions in you?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Not at all. The child was born a year after our marriage, and the
      husband was abroad when I first met Tekla&mdash;it happened right here, in
      this very house even, and that's why we come here every summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. No, then there can be no cause for suspicion. And you wouldn't
      have had any reason to trouble yourself anyhow, for the children of a
      widow who marries again often show a likeness to her dead husband. It is
      annoying, of course, and that's why they used to burn all widows in India,
      as you know.&mdash;But tell me: have you ever felt jealous of him&mdash;of
      his memory? Would it not sicken you to meet him on a walk and hear him,
      with his eyes on your Tekla, use the word "we" instead of "I"?&mdash;We!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. I cannot deny that I have been pursued by that very thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. There now!&mdash;And you'll never get rid of it. There are
      discords in this life which can never be reduced to harmony. For this
      reason you had better put wax in your ears and go to work. If you work,
      and grow old, and pile masses of new impressions on the hatches, then the
      corpse will stay quiet in the hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Pardon me for interrupting you, but&mdash;it is wonderful how you
      resemble Tekla now and then while you are talking. You have a way of
      blinking one eye as if you were taking aim with a gun, and your eyes have
      the same influence on me as hers have at times.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. No, really?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. And now you said that "no, really" in the same indifferent way
      that she does. She also has the habit of saying "no, really" quite often.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Perhaps we are distantly related, seeing that all human beings are
      said to be of one family. At any rate, it will be interesting to make your
      wife's acquaintance to see if what you say is true.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. And do you know, she never takes an expression from me. She seems
      rather to avoid my vocabulary, and I have never caught her using any of my
      gestures. And yet people as a rule develop what is called "marital
      resemblance."
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. And do you know why this has not happened in your case?&mdash;That
      woman has never loved you.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. What do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. I hope you will excuse what I am saying&mdash;but woman's love
      consists in taking, in receiving, and one from whom she takes nothing does
      not have her love. She has never loved you!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Don't you think her capable of loving more than once?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. No, for we cannot be deceived more than once. Then our eyes are
      opened once for all. You have never been deceived, and so you had better
      beware of those that have. They are dangerous, I tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Your words pierce me like knife thrusts, and I fool as if
      something were being severed within me, but I cannot help it. And this
      cutting brings a certain relief, too. For it means the pricking of ulcers
      that never seemed to ripen.&mdash;She has never loved me!&mdash;Why, then,
      did she ever take me?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Tell me first how she came to take you, and whether it was you who
      took her or she who took you?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Heaven only knows if I can tell at all!&mdash;How did it happen?
      Well, it didn't come about in one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Would you like to have me tell you how it did happen?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. That's more than you can do.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Oh, by using the information about yourself and your wife that you
      have given me, I think I can reconstruct the whole event. Listen now, and
      you'll hear. [In a dispassionate tone, almost humorously] The husband had
      gone abroad to study, and she was alone. At first her freedom seemed
      rather pleasant. Then came a sense of vacancy, for I presume she was
      pretty empty when she had lived by herself for a fortnight. Then he
      appeared, and by and by the vacancy was filled up. By comparison the
      absent one seemed to fade out, and for the simple reason that he was at a
      distance&mdash;you know the law about the square of the distance? But when
      they felt their passions stirring, then came fear&mdash;of themselves, of
      their consciences, of him. For protection they played brother and sister.
      And the more their feelings smacked of the flesh, the more they tried to
      make their relationship appear spiritual.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Brother and sister? How could you know that?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. I guessed it. Children are in the habit of playing papa and mamma,
      but when they grow up they play brother and sister&mdash;in order to hide
      what should be hidden!&mdash;And then they took the vow of chastity&mdash;and
      then they played hide-and-seek&mdash;until they got in a dark corner where
      they were sure of not being seen by anybody. [With mock severity] But they
      felt that there was ONE whose eye reached them in the darkness&mdash;and
      they grew frightened&mdash;and their fright raised the spectre of the
      absent one&mdash;his figure began to assume immense proportions&mdash;it
      became metamorphosed: turned into a nightmare that disturbed their amorous
      slumbers; a creditor who knocked at all doors. Then they saw his black
      hand between their own as these sneaked toward each other across the
      table; and they heard his grating voice through that stillness of the
      night that should have been broken only by the beating of their own
      pulses. He did not prevent them from possessing each other but he spoiled
      their happiness. And when they became aware of his invisible interference
      with their happiness; when they took flight at last&mdash;a vain flight
      from the memories that pursued them, from the liability they had left
      behind, from the public opinion they could not face&mdash;and when they
      found themselves without the strength needed to carry their own guilt,
      then they had to send out into the fields for a scapegoat to be
      sacrificed. They were free-thinkers, but they did not have the courage to
      step forward and speak openly to him the words: "We love each other!" To
      sum it up, they were cowards, and so the tyrant had to be slaughtered. Is
      that right?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Yes, but you forget that she educated me, that she filled my head
      with new thoughts&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. I have not forgotten it. But tell me: why could she not educate
      the other man also&mdash;into a free-thinker?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Oh, he was an idiot!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Oh, of course&mdash;he was an idiot! But that's rather an
      ambiguous term, and, as pictured in her novel, his idiocy seems mainly to
      have consisted in failure to understand her. Pardon me a question: but is
      your wife so very profound after all? I have discovered nothing profound
      in her writings.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Neither have I.&mdash;But then I have also to confess a certain
      difficulty in understanding her. It is as if the cogs of our brain wheels
      didn't fit into each other, and as if something went to pieces in my head
      when I try to comprehend her.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Maybe you are an idiot, too?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. I don't THINK so! And it seems to me all the time as if she were
      in the wrong&mdash;Would you care to read this letter, for instance, which
      I got today?
    </p>
    <p>
      [Takes out a letter from his pocket-book.]
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. [Glancing through the letter] Hm! The handwriting seems strangely
      familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Rather masculine, don't you think?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Well, I know at least ONE man who writes that kind of hand&mdash;She
      addresses you as "brother." Are you still playing comedy to each other?
      And do you never permit yourselves any greater familiarity in speaking to
      each other?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. No, it seems to me that all mutual respect is lost in that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. And is it to make you respect her that she calls herself your
      sister?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. I want to respect her more than myself. I want her to be the
      better part of my own self.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Why don't you be that better part yourself? Would it be less
      convenient than to permit somebody else to fill the part? Do you want to
      place yourself beneath your wife?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Yes, I do. I take a pleasure in never quite reaching up to her. I
      have taught her to swim, for example, and now I enjoy hearing her boast
      that she surpasses me both in skill and daring. To begin with, I merely
      pretended to be awkward and timid in order to raise her courage. And so it
      ended with my actually being her inferior, more of a coward than she. It
      almost seemed to me as if she had actually taken my courage away from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Have you taught her anything else?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Yes&mdash;but it must stay between us&mdash;I have taught her how
      to spell, which she didn't know before. But now, listen: when she took
      charge of our domestic correspondence, I grew out of the habit of writing.
      And think of it: as the years passed on, lack of practice made me forget a
      little here and there of my grammar. But do you think she recalls that I
      was the one who taught her at the start? No&mdash;and so I am "the idiot,"
      of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. So you are an idiot already?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Oh, it's just a joke, of course!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Of course! But this is clear cannibalism, I think. Do you know
      what's behind that sort of practice? The savages eat their enemies in
      order to acquire their useful qualities. And this woman has been eating
      your soul, your courage, your knowledge&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. And my faith! It was I who urged her to write her first book&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. [Making a face] Oh-h-h!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. It was I who praised her, even when I found her stuff rather poor.
      It was I who brought her into literary circles where she could gather
      honey from our most ornamental literary flowers. It was I who used my
      personal influence to keep the critics from her throat. It was I who blew
      her faith in herself into flame; blew on it until I lost my own breath. I
      gave, gave, gave&mdash;until I had nothing left for myself. Do you know&mdash;I'll
      tell you everything now&mdash;do you know I really believe&mdash;and the
      human soul is so peculiarly constituted&mdash;I believe that when my
      artistic successes seemed about to put her in the shadow&mdash;as well as
      her reputation&mdash;then I tried to put courage into her by belittling
      myself, and by making my own art seem inferior to hers. I talked so long
      about the insignificant part played by painting on the whole&mdash;talked
      so long about it, and invented so many reasons to prove what I said, that
      one fine day I found myself convinced of its futility. So all you had to
      do was to breathe on a house of cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Pardon me for recalling what you said at the beginning of our talk&mdash;that
      she had never taken anything from you.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. She doesn't nowadays. Because there is nothing more to take.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. The snake being full, it vomits now.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Perhaps she has been taking a good deal more from me than I have
      been aware of?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. You can be sure of that. She took when you were not looking, and
      that is called theft.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Perhaps she never did educate me?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. But you her? In all likelihood! But it was her trick to make it
      appear the other way to you. May I ask how she set about educating you?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Oh, first of all&mdash;hm!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Well, I&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. No, we were speaking of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Really, I cannot tell now.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Do you see!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. However&mdash;she devoured my faith also, and so I sank further
      and further down, until you came along and gave me a new faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. [Smiling] In sculpture?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Doubtfully] Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. And have you really faith in it? In this abstract, antiquated art
      that dates back to the childhood of civilisation? Do you believe that you
      can obtain your effect by pure form&mdash;by the three dimensions&mdash;tell
      me? That you can reach the practical mind of our own day, and convey an
      illusion to it, without the use of colour&mdash;without colour, mind you&mdash;do
      you really believe that?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Crushed] No!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Well, I don't either.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Why, then, did you say you did?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Because I pitied you.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Yes, I am to be pitied! For now I am bankrupt! Finished!&mdash;And
      worst of all: not even she is left to me!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Well, what could you do with her?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Oh, she would be to me what God was before I became an atheist: an
      object that might help me to exercise my sense of veneration.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Bury your sense of veneration and let something else grow on top
      of it. A little wholesome scorn, for instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. I cannot live without having something to respect&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Slave!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH.&mdash;without a woman to respect and worship!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Oh, HELL! Then you had better take back your God&mdash;if you
      needs must have something to kow-tow to! You're a fine atheist, with all
      that superstition about woman still in you! You're a fine free-thinker,
      who dare not think freely about the dear ladies! Do you know what that
      incomprehensible, sphinx-like, profound something in your wife really is?
      It is sheer stupidity!&mdash;Look here: she cannot even distinguish
      between th and t. And that, you know, means there is something wrong with
      the mechanism. When you look at the case, it looks like a chronometer, but
      the works inside are those of an ordinary cheap watch.&mdash;Nothing but
      the skirts-that's all! Put trousers on her, give her a pair of moustaches
      of soot under her nose, then take a good, sober look at her, and listen to
      her in the same manner: you'll find the instrument has another sound to
      it. A phonograph, and nothing else&mdash;giving you back your own words,
      or those of other people&mdash;and always in diluted form. Have you ever
      looked at a naked woman&mdash;oh yes, yes, of course! A youth with
      over-developed breasts; an under-developed man; a child that has shot up
      to full height and then stopped growing in other respects; one who is
      chronically anaemic: what can you expect of such a creature?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Supposing all that to be true&mdash;how can it be possible that I
      still think her my equal?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Hallucination&mdash;the hypnotising power of skirts! Or&mdash;the
      two of you may actually have become equals. The levelling process has been
      finished. Her capillarity has brought the water in both tubes to the same
      height.&mdash;Tell me [taking out his watch]: our talk has now lasted six
      hours, and your wife ought soon to be here. Don't you think we had better
      stop, so that you can get a rest?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. No, don't leave me! I don't dare to be alone!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Oh, for a little while only&mdash;and then the lady will come.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Yes, she is coming!&mdash;It's all so queer! I long for her, but I
      am afraid of her. She pets me, she is tender to me, but there is
      suffocation in her kisses&mdash;something that pulls and numbs. And I feel
      like a circus child that is being pinched by the clown in order that it
      may look rosy-cheeked when it appears before the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. I feel very sorry for you, my friend. Without being a physician, I
      can tell that you are a dying man. It is enough to look at your latest
      pictures in order to see that.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. You think so? How can you see it?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Your colour is watery blue, anaemic, thin, so that the cadaverous
      yellow of the canvas shines through. And it impresses me as if your own
      hollow, putty-coloured checks were showing beneath&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Oh, stop, stop!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Well, this is not only my personal opinion. Have you read to-day's
      paper?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Shrinking] No!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. It's on the table here.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Reaching for the paper without daring to take hold of it] Do they
      speak of it there?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Read it&mdash;or do you want me to read it to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. No!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. I'll leave you, if you want me to.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. No, no, no!&mdash;I don't know&mdash;it seems as if I were
      beginning to hate you, and yet I cannot let you go.&mdash;You drag me out
      of the hole into which I have fallen, but no sooner do you get me on firm
      ice, than you knock me on the head and shove me into the water again. As
      long as my secrets were my own, I had still something left within me, but
      now I am quite empty. There is a canvas by an Italian master, showing a
      scene of torture&mdash;a saint whose intestines are being torn out of him
      and rolled on the axle of a windlass. The martyr is watching himself grow
      thinner and thinner, while the roll on the axle grows thicker.&mdash;Now
      it seems to me as if you had swelled out since you began to dig in me; and
      when you leave, you'll carry away my vitals with you, and leave nothing
      but an empty shell behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. How you do let your fancy run away with you!&mdash;And besides,
      your wife is bringing back your heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. No, not since you have burned her to ashes. Everything is in ashes
      where you have passed along: my art, my love, my hope, my faith!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. All of it was pretty nearly finished before I came along.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Yes, but it might have been saved. Now it's too late&mdash;incendiary!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. We have cleared some ground only. Now we'll sow in the ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. I hate you! I curse you!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Good symptoms! There is still some strength left in you. And now
      I'll pull you up on the ice again. Listen now! Do you want to listen to
      me, and do you want to obey me?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Do with me what you will&mdash;I'll obey you!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. [Rising] Look at me!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Looking at GUSTAV] Now you are looking at me again with that
      other pair of eyes which attracts me.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. And listen to me!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Yes, but speak of yourself. Don't talk of me any longer: I am like
      an open wound and cannot bear being touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. No, there is nothing to say about me. I am a teacher of dead
      languages, and a widower&mdash;that's all! Take my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. What terrible power there must be in you! It feels as if I were
      touching an electrical generator.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. And bear in mind that I have been as weak as you are now.&mdash;Stand
      up!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Rises, but keeps himself from falling only by throwing his arms
      around the neck of GUSTAV] I am like a boneless baby, and my brain seems
      to lie bare.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Take a turn across the floor!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. I cannot!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Do what I say, or I'll strike you!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Straightening himself up] What are you saying?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. I'll strike you, I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Leaping backward in a rage] You!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. That's it! Now you have got the blood into your head, and your
      self-assurance is awake. And now I'll give you some electriticy: where is
      your wife?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Where is she?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. She is&mdash;at&mdash;a meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Sure?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Absolutely!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. What kind of meeting?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Oh, something relating to an orphan asylum.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Did you part as friends?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [With some hesitation] Not as friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. As enemies then!&mdash;What did you say that provoked her?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. You are terrible. I am afraid of you. How could you know?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. It's very simple: I possess three known factors, and with their
      help I figure out the unknown one. What did you say to her?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. I said&mdash;two words only, but they were dreadful, and I regret
      them&mdash;regret them very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Don't do it! Tell me now?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. I said: "Old flirt!"
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. What more did you say?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Nothing at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Yes, you did, but you have forgotten it&mdash;perhaps because you
      don't dare remember it. You have put it away in a secret drawer, but you
      have got to open it now!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. I can't remember!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. But I know. This is what you said: "You ought to be ashamed of
      flirting when you are too old to have any more lovers!"
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Did I say that? I must have said it!&mdash;But how can you know
      that I did?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. I heard her tell the story on board the boat as I came here.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. To whom?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. To four young men who formed her company. She is already
      developing a taste for chaste young men, just like&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. But there is nothing wrong in that?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. No more than in playing brother and sister when you are papa and
      mamma.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. So you have seen her then?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Yes, I have. But you have never seen her when you didn't&mdash;I
      mean, when you were not present. And there's the reason, you see, why a
      husband can never really know his wife. Have you a portrait of her?
    </p>
    <p>
      (Adolph takes a photograph from his pocketbook. There is a look of aroused
      curiosity on his face.)
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. You were not present when this was taken?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Look at it. Does it bear much resemblance to the portrait you
      painted of her? Hardly any! The features are the same, but the expression
      is quite different. But you don't see this, because your own picture of
      her creeps in between your eyes and this one. Look at it now as a painter,
      without giving a thought to the original. What does it represent? Nothing,
      so far as I can see, but an affected coquette inviting somebody to come
      and play with her. Do you notice this cynical line around the mouth which
      you are never allowed to see? Can you see that her eyes are seeking out
      some man who is not you? Do you observe that her dress is cut low at the
      neck, that her hair is done up in a different way, that her sleeve has
      managed to slip back from her arm? Can you see?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Yes&mdash;now I see.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Look out, my boy!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. For what?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. For her revenge! Bear in mind that when you said she could not
      attract a man, you struck at what to her is most sacred&mdash;the one
      thing above all others. If you had told her that she wrote nothing but
      nonsense, she would have laughed at your poor taste. But as it is&mdash;believe
      me, it will not be her fault if her desire for revenge has not already
      been satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. I must know if it is so!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Find out!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Find out?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Watch&mdash;I'll assist you, if you want me to.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. As I am to die anyhow&mdash;it may as well come first as last!
      What am I to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. First of all a piece of information: has your wife any vulnerable
      point?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Hardly! I think she must have nine lives, like a cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. There&mdash;that was the boat whistling at the landing&mdash;now
      she'll soon be here.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Then I must go down and meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. No, you are to stay here. You have to be impolite. If her
      conscience is clear, you'll catch it until your ears tingle. If she is
      guilty, she'll come up and pet you.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Are you so sure of that?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Not quite, because a rabbit will sometimes turn and run in loops,
      but I'll follow. My room is nest to this. [He points to the door on the
      right] There I shall take up my position and watch you while you are
      playing the game in here. But when you are done, we'll change parts: I'll
      enter the cage and do tricks with the snake while you stick to the
      key-hole. Then we meet in the park to compare notes. But keep your back
      stiff. And if you feel yourself weakening, knock twice on the floor with a
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. All right!&mdash;But don't go away. I must be sure that you are in
      the next room.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. You can be quite sure of that. But don't get scared afterward,
      when you watch me dissecting a human soul and laying out its various parts
      on the table. They say it is rather hard on a beginner, but once you have
      seen it done, you never want to miss it.&mdash;And be sure to remember one
      thing: not a word about having met me, or having made any new acquaintance
      whatever while she was away. Not one word! And I'll discover her weak
      point by myself. Hush, she has arrived&mdash;she is in her room now. She's
      humming to herself. That means she is in a rage!&mdash;Now, straight in
      the back, please! And sit down on that chair over there, so that she has
      to sit here&mdash;then I can watch both of you at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. It's only fifteen minutes to dinner&mdash;and no new guests have
      arrived&mdash;for I haven't heard the bell ring. That means we shall be by
      ourselves&mdash;worse luck!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Are you weak?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. I am nothing at all!&mdash;Yes, I am afraid of what is now coming!
      But I cannot keep it from coming! The stone has been set rolling&mdash;and
      it was not the first drop of water that started it&mdash;nor wad it the
      last one&mdash;but all of them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Let it roll then&mdash;for peace will come in no other way.
      Good-bye for a while now! [Goes out]
    </p>
    <p>
      (ADOLPH nods back at him. Until then he has been standing with the
      photograph in his hand. Now he tears it up and flings the pieces under the
      table. Then he sits down on a chair, pulls nervously at his tie, runs his
      fingers through his hair, crumples his coat lapel, and so on.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [Enters, goes straight up to him and gives him a kiss; her manner
      is friendly, frank, happy, and engaging] Hello, little brother! How is he
      getting on?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Almost won over; speaking reluctantly and as if in jest] What
      mischief have you been up to now that makes you come and kiss me?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. I'll tell you: I've spent an awful lot of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. You have had a good time then?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Very! But not exactly at that creche meeting. That was plain
      piffle, to tell the truth.&mdash;But what has little brother found to
      divert himself with while his Pussy was away?
    </p>
    <p>
      (Her eyes wander around the room as if she were looking for somebody or
      sniffing something.)
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. I've simply been bored.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. And no company at all?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Quite by myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [Watching him; she sits down on the sofa] Who has been sitting
      here? ADOLPH. Over there? Nobody.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. That's funny! The seat is still warm, and there is a hollow here
      that looks as if it had been made by an elbow. Have you had lady callers?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. I? You don't believe it, do you?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. But you blush. I think little brother is not telling the truth.
      Come and tell Pussy now what he has on his conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Draws him toward herself so that he sinks down with his head resting in
      her lap.)
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. You're a little devil&mdash;do you know that?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. No, I don't know anything at all about myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. You never think about yourself, do you?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [Sniffing and taking notes] I think of nothing but myself&mdash;I
      am a dreadful egoist. But what has made you turn so philosophical all at
      once?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Put your hand on my forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [Prattling as if to a baby] Has he got ants in his head again? Does
      he want me to take them away, does he? [Kisses him on the forehead] There
      now! Is it all right now?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Now it's all right. [Pause]
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Well, tell me now what you have been doing to make the time go?
      Have you painted anything?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. No, I am done with painting.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. What? Done with painting?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Yes, but don't scold me for it. How can I help it that I can't
      paint any longer!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. What do you mean to do then?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. I'll become a sculptor.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. What a lot of brand new ideas again!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Yes, but please don't scold! Look at that figure over there.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [Uncovering the wax figure] Well, I declare!&mdash;Who is that
      meant for?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Guess!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Is it Pussy? Has he got no shame at all?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Is it like?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. How can I tell when there is no face?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Yes, but there is so much else&mdash;that's beautiful!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [Taps him playfully on the cheek] Now he must keep still or I'll
      have to kiss him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Holding her back] Now, now!&mdash;Somebody might come!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Well, what do I care? Can't I kiss my own husband, perhaps? Oh yes,
      that's my lawful right.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Yes, but don't you know&mdash;in the hotel here, they don't
      believe we are married, because we are kissing each other such a lot. And
      it makes no difference that we quarrel now and then, for lovers are said
      to do that also.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Well, but what's the use of quarrelling? Why can't he always be as
      nice as he is now? Tell me now? Can't he try? Doesn't he want us to be
      happy?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Do I want it? Yes, but&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. There we are again! Who has put it into his head that he is not to
      paint any longer?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Who? You are always looking for somebody else behind me and my
      thoughts. Are you jealous?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Yes, I am. I'm afraid somebody might take him away from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Are you really afraid of that? You who know that no other woman
      can take your place, and that I cannot live without you!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Well, I am not afraid of the women&mdash;it's your friends that
      fill your head with all sorts of notions.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Watching her] You are afraid then? Of what are you afraid?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [Getting up] Somebody has been here. Who has been here?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Don't you wish me to look at you?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Not in that way: it's not the way you are accustomed to look at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. How was I looking at you then?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Way up under my eyelids.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Under your eyelids&mdash;yes, I wanted to see what is behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. See all you can! There is nothing that needs to be hidden. But&mdash;you
      talk differently, too&mdash;you use expressions&mdash;[studying him] you
      philosophise&mdash;that's what you do! [Approaches him threateningly] Who
      has been here?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Nobody but my physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Your physician? Who is he?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. That doctor from Stromstad.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. What's his name?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Sjoberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. What did he have to say?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. He said&mdash;well&mdash;among other things he said&mdash;that I
      am on the verge of epilepsy&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Among other things? What more did he say?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Something very unpleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Tell me!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. He forbade us to live as man and wife for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Oh, that's it! Didn't I just guess it! They want to separate us!
      That's what I have understood a long time!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. You can't have understood, because there was nothing to
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Oh yes, I have!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. How can you see what doesn't exist, unless your fear of something
      has stirred up your fancy into seeing what has never existed? What is it
      you fear? That I might borrow somebody else's eyes in order to see you as
      you are, and not as you seem to be?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Keep your imagination in check, Adolph! It is the beast that dwells
      in man's soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Where did you learn that? From those chaste young men on the boat&mdash;did
      you?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [Not at all abashed] Yes, there is something to be learned from
      youth also.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. I think you are already beginning to have a taste for youth?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. I have always liked youth. That's why I love you. Do you object?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. No, but I should prefer to have no partners.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [Prattling roguishly] My heart is so big, little brother, that
      there is room in it for many more than him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. But little brother doesn't want any more brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Come here to Pussy now and get his hair pulled because he is
      jealous&mdash;no, envious is the right word for it!
    </p>
    <p>
      (Two knocks with a chair are heard from the adjoining room, where GUSTAV
      is.)
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. No, I don't want to play now. I want to talk seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [Prattling] Mercy me, does he want to talk seriously? Dreadful, how
      serious he's become! [Takes hold of his head and kisses him] Smile a
      little&mdash;there now!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Smiling against his will] Oh, you're the&mdash;I might almost
      think you knew how to use magic!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Well, can't he see now? That's why he shouldn't start any trouble&mdash;or
      I might use my magic to make him invisible!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Gets up] Will you sit for me a moment, Tekla? With the side of
      your face this way, so that I can put a face on my figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Of course, I will.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Turns her head so he can see her in profile.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Gazes hard at her while pretending to work at the figure] Don't
      think of me now&mdash;but of somebody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. I'll think of my latest conquest.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. That chaste young man?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Exactly! He had a pair of the prettiest, sweetest moustaches, and
      his cheek looked like a peach&mdash;it was so soft and rosy that you just
      wanted to bite it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Darkening] Please keep that expression about the mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. What expression?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. A cynical, brazen one that I have never seen before.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [Making a face] This one?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Just that one! [Getting up] Do you know how Bret Harte pictures an
      adulteress?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [Smiling] No, I have never read Bret Something.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. As a pale creature that cannot blush.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Not at all? But when she meets her lover, then she must blush, I am
      sure, although her husband or Mr. Bret may not be allowed to see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Are you so sure of that?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [As before] Of course, as the husband is not capable of bringing
      the blood up to her head, he cannot hope to behold the charming spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Enraged] Tekla!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Oh, you little ninny!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Tekla!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. He should call her Pussy&mdash;then I might get up a pretty little
      blush for his sake. Does he want me to?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Disarmed] You minx, I'm so angry with you, that I could bite you!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [Playfully] Come and bite me then!&mdash;Come!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Opens her arms to him.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Puts his hands around her neck and kisses her] Yes, I'll bite you
      to death!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [Teasingly] Look out&mdash;somebody might come!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Well, what do I care! I care for nothing else in the world if I
      can only have you!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. And when, you don't have me any longer?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Then I shall die!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. But you are not afraid of losing me, are you&mdash;as I am too old
      to be wanted by anybody else?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. You have not forgotten my words yet, Tekla! I take it all back
      now!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Can you explain to me why you are at once so jealous and so
      cock-sure?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. No, I cannot explain anything at all. But it's possible that the
      thought of somebody else having possessed you may still be gnawing within
      me. At times it appears to me as if our love were nothing but a fiction,
      an attempt at self-defence, a passion kept up as a matter of honor&mdash;and
      I can't think of anything that would give me more pain than to have HIM
      know that I am unhappy. Oh, I have never seen him&mdash;but the mere
      thought that a person exists who is waiting for my misfortune to arrive,
      who is daily calling down curses on my head, who will roar with laughter
      when I perish&mdash;the mere idea of it obsesses me, drives me nearer to
      you, fascinates me, paralyses me!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Do you think I would let him have that joy? Do you think I would
      make his prophecy come true?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. No, I cannot think you would.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Why don't you keep calm then?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. No, you upset me constantly by your coquetry. Why do you play that
      kind of game?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. It is no game. I want to be admired&mdash;that's all!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Yes, but only by men!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Of course! For a woman is never admired by other women.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Tell me, have you heard anything&mdash;from him&mdash;recently?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Not in the last sis months.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Do you ever think of him?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. No!&mdash;Since the child died we have broken off our
      correspondence.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. And you have never seen him at all?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. No, I understand he is living somewhere down on the West Coast. But
      why is all this coming into your head just now?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. I don't know. But during the last few days, while I was alone, I
      kept thinking of him&mdash;how he might have felt when he was left alone
      that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Are you having an attack of bad conscience?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. You feel like a thief, do you?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Almost!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Isn't that lovely! Women can be stolen as you steal children or
      chickens? And you regard me as his chattel or personal property. I am very
      much obliged to you!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. No, I regard you as his wife. And that's a good deal more than
      property&mdash;for there can be no substitute. TEKLA. Oh, yes! If you only
      heard that he had married again, all these foolish notions would leave
      you.&mdash;Have you not taken his place with me?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Well, have I?&mdash;And did you ever love him?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Of course, I did!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. And then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. I grew tired of him!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. And if you should tire of me also?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. But I won't!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. If somebody else should turn up&mdash;one who had all the
      qualities you are looking for in a man now&mdash;suppose only&mdash;then
      you would leave me?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. If he captivated you? So that you couldn't live without him? Then
      you would leave me, of course?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. No, that doesn't follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. But you couldn't love two at the same time, could you?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Yes! Why not?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. That's something I cannot understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. But things exist although you do not understand them. All persons
      are not made in the same way, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. I begin to see now!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. No, really!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. No, really? [A pause follows, during which he seems to struggle
      with some&mdash;memory that will not come back] Do you know, Tekla, that
      your frankness is beginning to be painful?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. And yet it used to be my foremost virtue In your mind, and one that
      you taught me.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Yes, but it seems to me as if you were hiding something behind
      that frankness of yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. That's the new tactics, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. I don't know why, but this place has suddenly become offensive to
      me. If you feel like it, we might return home&mdash;this evening!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. What kind of notion is that? I have barely arrived and I don't feel
      like starting on another trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. But I want to.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Well, what's that to me?&mdash;You can go!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. But I demand that you take the next boat with me!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Demand?&mdash;What are you talking about?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Do you realise that you are my wife?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Do you realise that you are my husband?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Well, there's a difference between those two things.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Oh, that's the way you are talking now!&mdash;You have never loved
      me!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Haven't I?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. No, for to love is to give.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. To love like a man is to give; to love like a woman is to take.&mdash;And
      I have given, given, given!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Pooh! What have you given?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Everything!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. That's a lot! And if it be true, then I must have taken it. Are you
      beginning to send in bills for your gifts now? And if I have taken
      anything, this proves only my love for you. A woman cannot receive
      anything except from her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Her lover, yes! There you spoke the truth! I have been your lover,
      but never your husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Well, isn't that much more agreeable&mdash;to escape playing
      chaperon? But if you are not satisfied with your position, I'll send you
      packing, for I don't want a husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. No, that's what I have noticed. For a while ago, when you began to
      sneak away from me like a thief with his booty, and when you began to seek
      company of your own where you could flaunt my plumes and display my gems,
      then I felt, like reminding you of your debt. And at once I became a
      troublesome creditor whom you wanted to get rid of. You wanted to
      repudiate your own notes, and in order not to increase your debt to me,
      you stopped pillaging my safe and began to try those of other people
      instead. Without having done anything myself, I became to you merely the
      husband. And now I am going to be your husband whether you like it or not,
      as I am not allowed to be your lover any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [Playfully] Now he shouldn't talk nonsense, the sweet little idiot!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Look out: it's dangerous to think everybody an idiot but oneself!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. But that's what everybody thinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. And I am beginning to suspect that he&mdash;your former husband&mdash;was
      not so much of an idiot after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Heavens! Are you beginning to sympathise with&mdash;him?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Yes, not far from it,
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Well, well! Perhaps you would like to make his acquaintance and
      pour out your overflowing heart to him? What a striking picture! But I am
      also beginning to feel drawn to him, as I am growing more and more tired
      of acting as wetnurse. For he was at least a man, even though he had the
      fault of being married to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. There, you see! But you had better not talk so loud&mdash;we might
      be overheard.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. What would it matter if they took us for married people?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. So now you are getting fond of real male men also, and at the same
      time you have a taste for chaste young men?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. There are no limits to what I can like, as you may see. My heart is
      open to everybody and everything, to the big and the small, the handsome
      and the ugly, the new and the old&mdash;I love the whole world.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Do you know what that means?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. No, I don't know anything at all. I just FEEL.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. It means that old age is near.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. There you are again! Take care!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Take care yourself!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Of what?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Of the knife!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [Prattling] Little brother had better not play with such dangerous
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. I have quit playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Oh, it's earnest, is it? Dead earnest! Then I'll show you that&mdash;you
      are mistaken. That is to say&mdash;you'll never see it, never know it, but
      all the rest of the world will know It. And you'll suspect it, you'll
      believe it, and you'll never have another moment's peace. You'll have the
      feeling of being ridiculous, of being deceived, but you'll never get any
      proof of it. For that's what married men never get.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. You hate me then?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. No, I don't. And I don't think I shall either. But that's probably
      because you are nothing to me but a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. At this moment, yes. But do you remember how it was while the
      storm swept over us? Then you lay there like an infant in arms and just
      cried. Then you had to sit on my lap, and I had to kiss your eyes to
      sleep. Then I had to be your nurse; had to see that you fixed your hair
      before going out; had to send your shoes to the cobbler, and see that
      there was food in the house. I had to sit by your side, holding your hand
      for hours at a time: you were afraid, afraid of the whole world, because
      you didn't have a single friend, and because you were crushed by the
      hostility of public opinion. I had to talk courage into you until my mouth
      was dry and my head ached. I had to make myself believe that I was strong.
      I had to force myself into believing in the future. And so I brought you
      back to life, when you seemed already dead. Then you admired me. Then I
      was the man&mdash;not that kind of athlete you had just left, but the man
      of will-power, the mesmerist who instilled new nervous energy into your
      flabby muscles and charged your empty brain with a new store of
      electricity. And then I gave you back your reputation. I brought you new
      friends, furnished you with a little court of people who, for the sake of
      friendship to me, let themselves be lured into admiring you. I set you to
      rule me and my house. Then I painted my best pictures, glimmering with
      reds and blues on backgrounds of gold, and there was not an exhibition
      then where I didn't hold a place of honour. Sometimes you were St.
      Cecilia, and sometimes Mary Stuart&mdash;or little Karin, whom King Eric
      loved. And I turned public attention in your direction. I compelled the
      clamorous herd to see you with my own infatuated vision. I plagued them
      with your personality, forced you literally down their throats, until that
      sympathy which makes everything possible became yours at last&mdash;and
      you could stand on your own feet. When you reached that far, then my
      strength was used up, and I collapsed from the overstrain&mdash;in lifting
      you up, I had pushed myself down. I was taken ill, and my illness seemed
      an annoyance to you at the moment when all life had just begun to smile at
      you&mdash;and sometimes it seemed to me as if, in your heart, there was a
      secret desire to get rid of your creditor and the witness of your rise.
      Your love began to change into that of a grown-up sister, and for lack of
      better I accustomed myself to the new part of little brother. Your
      tenderness for me remained, and even increased, but it was mingled with a
      suggestion of pity that had in it a good deal of contempt. And this
      changed into open scorn as my talent withered and your own sun rose
      higher. But in some mysterious way the fountainhead of your inspiration
      seemed to dry up when I could no longer replenish it&mdash;or rather when
      you wanted to show its independence of me. And at last both of us began to
      lose ground. And then you looked for somebody to put the blame on. A new
      victim! For you are weak, and you can never carry your own burdens of
      guilt and debt. And so you picked me for a scapegoat and doomed me to
      slaughter. But when you cut my thews, you didn't realise that you were
      also crippling yourself, for by this time our years of common life had
      made twins of us. You were a shoot sprung from my stem, and you wanted to
      cut yourself loose before the shoot had put out roots of its own, and
      that's why you couldn't grow by yourself. And my stem could not spare its
      main branch&mdash;and so stem and branch must die together.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. What you mean with all this, of course, is that you have written my
      books.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. No, that's what you want me to mean in order to make me out a
      liar. I don't use such crude expressions as you do, and I spoke for
      something like five minutes to get in all the nuances, all the halftones,
      all the transitions&mdash;but your hand-organ has only a single note in
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Yes, but the summary of the whole story is that you have written my
      books.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. No, there is no summary. You cannot reduce a chord into a single
      note. You cannot translate a varied life into a sum of one figure. I have
      made no blunt statements like that of having written your books.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. But that's what you meant!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Beyond himself] I did not mean it.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. But the sum of it&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Wildly] There can be no sum without an addition. You get an
      endless decimal fraction for quotient when your division does not work out
      evenly. I have not added anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. But I can do the adding myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. I believe it, but then I am not doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. No, but that's what you wanted to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Exhausted, closing his eyes] No, no, no&mdash;don't speak to me&mdash;you'll
      drive me into convulsions. Keep silent! Leave me alone! You mutilate my
      brain with your clumsy pincers&mdash;you put your claws into my thoughts
      and tear them to pieces!
    </p>
    <p>
      (He seems almost unconscious and sits staring straight ahead while his
      thumbs are bent inward against the palms of his hands.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [Tenderly] What is it? Are you sick?
    </p>
    <p>
      (ADOLPH motions her away.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Adolph!
    </p>
    <p>
      (ADOLPH shakes his head at her.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Adolph.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Do you admit that you were unjust a moment ago?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Yes, yes, yes, yes, I admit!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. And do you ask my pardon?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Yes, yes, yes, I ask your pardon&mdash;if you only won't speak to
      me!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Kiss my hand then!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [Kissing her hand] I'll kiss your hand&mdash;if you only don't
      speak to me!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. And now you had better go out for a breath of fresh air before
      dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Yes, I think I need it. And then we'll pack and leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. No!
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. [On his feet] Why? There must be a reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. The reason is that I have promised to be at the concert to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Oh, that's it!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Yes, that's it. I have promised to attend&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Promised? Probably you said only that you might go, and that
      wouldn't prevent you from saying now that you won't go.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. No, I am not like you: I keep my word.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Of course, promises should be kept, but we don't have to live up
      to every little word we happen to drop. Perhaps there is somebody who has
      made you promise to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Then you can ask to be released from your promise because your
      husband is sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA, No, I don't want to do that, and you are not sick enough to be kept
      from going with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Why do you always want to drag me along? Do you feel safer then?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. I don't know what you mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. That's what you always say when you know I mean something that&mdash;doesn't
      please you.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. So-o! What is it now that doesn't please me?
    </p>
    <p>
      ADOLPH. Oh, I beg you, don't begin over again&mdash;Good-bye for a while!
    </p>
    <p>
      (Goes out through the door in the rear and then turns to the right.)
    </p>
    <p>
      (TEKLA is left alone. A moment later GUSTAV enters and goes straight up to
      the table as if looking for a newspaper. He pretends not to see TEKLA.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [Shows agitation, but manages to control herself] Oh, is it you?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Yes, it's me&mdash;I beg your pardon!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Which way did you come?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. By land. But&mdash;I am not going to stay, as&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Oh, there is no reason why you shouldn't.&mdash;Well, it was some
      time ago&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Yes, some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. You have changed a great deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. And you are as charming as ever, A little younger, if anything.
      Excuse me, however&mdash;I am not going to spoil your happiness by my
      presence. And if I had known you were here, I should never&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. If you don't think it improper, I should like you to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. On my part there could be no objection, but I fear&mdash;well,
      whatever I say, I am sure to offend you.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Sit down a moment. You don't offend me, for you possess that rare
      gift&mdash;which was always yours&mdash;of tact and politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. It's very kind of you. But one could hardly expect&mdash;that your
      husband might regard my qualities in the same generous light as you.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. On the contrary, he has just been speaking of you in very
      sympathetic terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Oh!&mdash;Well, everything becomes covered up by time, like names
      cut in a tree&mdash;and not even dislike can maintain itself permanently
      in our minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. He has never disliked you, for he has never seen you. And as for
      me, I have always cherished a dream&mdash;that of seeing you come together
      as friends&mdash;or at least of seeing you meet for once in my presence&mdash;of
      seeing you shake hands&mdash;and then go your different ways again.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. It has also been my secret longing to see her whom I used to love
      more than my own life&mdash;to make sure that she was in good hands. And
      although I have heard nothing but good of him, and am familiar with all
      his work, I should nevertheless have liked, before it grew too late, to
      look into his eyes and beg him to take good care of the treasure
      Providence has placed in his possession. In that way I hoped also to lay
      the hatred that must have developed instinctively between us; I wished to
      bring some peace and humility into my soul, so that I might manage to live
      through the rest of my sorrowful days.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. You have uttered my own thoughts, and you have understood me. I
      thank you for it!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Oh, I am a man of small account, and have always been too
      insignificant to keep you in the shadow. My monotonous way of living, my
      drudgery, my narrow horizons&mdash;all that could not satisfy a soul like
      yours, longing for liberty. I admit it. But you understand&mdash;you who
      have searched the human soul&mdash;what it cost me to make such a
      confession to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. It is noble, it is splendid, to acknowledge one's own shortcomings&mdash;and
      it's not everybody that's capable of it. [Sighs] But yours has always been
      an honest, and faithful, and reliable nature&mdash;one that I had to
      respect&mdash;but&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Not always&mdash;not at that time! But suffering purifies, sorrow
      ennobles, and&mdash;I have suffered!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Poor Gustav! Can you forgive me? Tell me, can you?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Forgive? What? I am the one who must ask you to forgive.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [Changing tone] I believe we are crying, both of us&mdash;we who
      are old enough to know better!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. [Feeling his way] Old? Yes, I am old. But you&mdash;you grow
      younger every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      (He has by that time manoeuvred himself up to the chair on the left and
      sits down on it, whereupon TEKLA sits down on the sofa.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Do you think so?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. And then you know how to dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. I learned that from you. Don't you remember how you figured out
      what colors would be most becoming to me?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Yes, don't you remember&mdash;hm!&mdash;I can even recall how you
      used to be angry with me whenever I failed to have at least a touch of
      crimson about my dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. No, not angry! I was never angry with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Oh, yes, when you wanted to teach me how to think&mdash;do you
      remember? For that was something I couldn't do at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Of course, you could. It's something every human being does. And
      you have become quite keen at it&mdash;at least when you write.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [Unpleasantly impressed; hurrying her words] Well, my dear Gustav,
      it is pleasant to see you anyhow, and especially in a peaceful way like
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Well, I can hardly be called a troublemaker, and you had a pretty
      peaceful time with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Perhaps too much so.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Oh! But you see, I thought you wanted me that way. It was at least
      the impression you gave me while we were engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Do you think one really knows what one wants at that time? And then
      the mammas insist on all kinds of pretensions, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Well, now you must be having all the excitement you can wish. They
      say that life among artists is rather swift, and I don't think your
      husband can be called a sluggard.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. You can get too much of a good thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. [Trying a new tack] What! I do believe you are still wearing the
      ear-rings I gave you?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [Embarrassed] Why not? There was never any quarrel between us&mdash;and
      then I thought I might wear them as a token&mdash;and a reminder&mdash;that
      we were not enemies. And then, you know, it is impossible to buy this kind
      of ear-rings any longer. [Takes off one of her ear-rings.]
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Oh, that's all right, but what does your husband say of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Why should I mind what he says?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Don't you mind that?&mdash;But you may be doing him an injury. It
      is likely to make him ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [Brusquely, as if speaking to herself almost] He was that before!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. [Rises when he notes her difficulty in putting back the ear-ring]
      May I help you, perhaps?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Oh&mdash;thank you!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. [Pinching her ear] That tiny ear!&mdash;Think only if your husband
      could see us now!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Wouldn't he howl, though!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Is he jealous also?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Is he? I should say so!
    </p>
    <p>
      [A noise is heard from the room on the right.]
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Who lives in that room?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. I don't know.&mdash;But tell me how you are getting along and what
      you are doing?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Tell me rather how you are getting along?
    </p>
    <p>
      (TEKLA is visibly confused, and without realising what she is doing, she
      takes the cover off the wax figure.)
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Hello! What's that?&mdash;Well!&mdash;It must be you!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. I don't believe so.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. But it is very like you.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [Cynically] Do you think so?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. That reminds me of the story&mdash;you know it&mdash;"How could
      your majesty see that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA, [Laughing aloud] You are impossible!&mdash;Do you know any new
      stories?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. No, but you ought to have some.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Oh, I never hear anything funny nowadays.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Is he modest also?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Oh&mdash;well&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Not an everything?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. He isn't well just now.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Well, why should little brother put his nose into other people's
      hives?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [Laughing] You crazy thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Poor chap!&mdash;Do you remember once when we were just married&mdash;we
      lived in this very room. It was furnished differently in those days. There
      was a chest of drawers against that wall there&mdash;and over there stood
      the big bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Now you stop!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Look at me!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Well, why shouldn't I?
    </p>
    <p>
      [They look hard at each other.]
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Do you think a person can ever forget anything that has made a
      very deep impression on him?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. No! And our memories have a tremendous power. Particularly the
      memories of our youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Do you remember when I first met you? Then you were a pretty
      little girl: a slate on which parents and governesses had made a few
      scrawls that I had to wipe out. And then I filled it with inscriptions
      that suited my own mind, until you believed the slate could hold nothing
      more. That's the reason, you know, why I shouldn't care to be in your
      husband's place&mdash;well, that's his business! But it's also the reason
      why I take pleasure in meeting you again. Our thoughts fit together
      exactly. And as I sit here and chat with you, it seems to me like drinking
      old wine of my own bottling. Yes, it's my own wine, but it has gained a
      great deal in flavour! And now, when I am about to marry again, I have
      purposely picked out a young girl whom I can educate to suit myself. For
      the woman, you know, is the man's child, and if she is not, he becomes
      hers, and then the world turns topsy-turvy.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Are you going to marry again?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Yes, I want to try my luck once more, but this time I am going to
      make a better start, so that it won't end again with a spill.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Is she good looking?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Yes, to me. But perhaps I am too old. It's queer&mdash;now when
      chance has brought me together with you again&mdash;I am beginning to
      doubt whether it will be possible to play the game over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. How do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. I can feel that my roots stick in your soil, and the old wounds
      are beginning to break open. You are a dangerous woman, Tekla!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Am I? And my young husband says that I can make no more conquests.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. That means he has ceased to love you.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Well, I can't quite make out what love means to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. You have been playing hide and seek so long that at last you
      cannot find each other at all. Such things do happen. You have had to play
      the innocent to yourself, until he has lost his courage. There ARE some
      drawbacks to a change, I tell you&mdash;there are drawbacks to it, indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Do you mean to reproach&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Not at all! Whatever happens is to a certain extent necessary, for
      if it didn't happen, something else would&mdash;but now it did happen, and
      so it had to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. YOU are a man of discernment. And I have never met anybody with
      whom I liked so much to exchange ideas. You are so utterly free from all
      morality and preaching, and you ask so little of people, that it is
      possible to be oneself in your presence. Do you know, I am jealous of your
      intended wife!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. And do you realise that I am jealous of your husband?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [Rising] And now we must part! Forever!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Yes, we must part! But not without a farewell&mdash;or what do you
      say?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [Agitated] No!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. [Following after her] Yes!&mdash;Let us have a farewell! Let us
      drown our memories&mdash;you know, there are intoxications so deep that
      when you wake up all memories are gone. [Putting his arm around her waist]
      You have been dragged down by a diseased spirit, who is infecting you with
      his own anaemia. I'll breathe new life into you. I'll make your talent
      blossom again in your autumn days, like a remontant rose. I'll&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      (Two LADIES in travelling dress are seen in the doorway leading to the
      veranda. They look surprised. Then they point at those within, laugh, and
      disappear.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [Freeing herself] Who was that?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. [Indifferently] Some tourists.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Leave me alone! I am afraid of you!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. You take my soul away from me!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. And give you my own in its place! And you have no soul for that
      matter&mdash;it's nothing but a delusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. You have a way of saying impolite things so that nobody can be
      angry with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. It's because you feel that I hold the first mortgage on you&mdash;Tell
      me now, when&mdash;and&mdash;where?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. No, it wouldn't be right to him. I think he is still in love with
      me, and I don't want to do any more harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. He does not love you! Do you want proofs?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA, Where can you get them?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. [Picking up the pieces of the photograph from the floor] Here! See
      for yourself!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Oh, that's an outrage!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Do you see? Now then, when? And where?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. The false-hearted wretch!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. When?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. He leaves to-night, with the eight-o'clock boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. And then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. At nine! [A noise is heard from the adjoining room] Who can be
      living in there that makes such a racket?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Let's see! [Goes over and looks through the keyhole] There's a
      table that has been upset, and a smashed water caraffe&mdash;that's all! I
      shouldn't wonder if they had left a dog locked up in there.&mdash;At nine
      o'clock then?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. All right! And let him answer for it himself.&mdash;What a depth of
      deceit! And he who has always preached about truthfulness, and tried to
      teach me to tell the truth!&mdash;But wait a little&mdash;how was it now?
      He received me with something like hostility&mdash;didn't meet me at the
      landing&mdash;and then&mdash;and then he made some remark about young men
      on board the boat, which I pretended not to hear&mdash;but how could he
      know? Wait&mdash;and then he began to philosophise about women&mdash;and
      then the spectre of you seemed to be haunting him&mdash;and he talked of
      becoming a sculptor, that being the art of the time&mdash;exactly in
      accordance with your old speculations!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. No, really!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. No, really?&mdash;Oh, now I understand! Now I begin to see what a
      hideous creature you are! You have been here before and stabbed him to
      death! It was you who had been sitting there on the sofa; it was you who
      made him think himself an epileptic&mdash;that he had to live in celibacy;
      that he ought to rise in rebellion against his wife; yes, it was you!&mdash;How
      long have you been here?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. I have been here a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. It was you, then, I saw on board the boat?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. It was.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. And now you were thinking you could trap me?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. It has been done.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Not yet!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Yes!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Like a wolf you went after my lamb. You came here with a villainous
      plan to break up my happiness, and you were carrying it out, when my eyes
      were opened, and I foiled you.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Not quite that way, if you please. This is how it happened in
      reality. Of course, it has been my secret hope that disaster might
      overtake you. But I felt practically certain that no interference on my
      part was required. And besides, I have been far too busy to have any time
      left for intriguing. But when I happened to be moving about a bit, and
      happened to see you with those young men on board the boat, then I guessed
      the time had come for me to take a look at the situation. I came here, and
      your lamb threw itself into the arms of the wolf. I won his affection by
      some sort of reminiscent impression which I shall not be tactless enough
      to explain to you. At first he aroused my sympathy, because he seemed to
      be in the same fix as I was once. But then he happened to touch old wounds&mdash;that
      book, you know, and "the idiot"&mdash;and I was seized with a wish to pick
      him to pieces, and to mix up these so thoroughly that they couldn't be put
      together again&mdash;and I succeeded, thanks to the painstaking way in
      which you had done the work of preparation. Then I had to deal with you.
      For you were the spring that had kept the works moving, and you had to be
      taken apart&mdash;and what a buzzing followed!&mdash;When I came in here,
      I didn't know exactly what to say. Like a chess-player, I had laid a
      number of tentative plans, of course, but my play had to depend on your
      moves. One thing led to the other, chance lent me a hand, and finally I
      had you where I wanted you.&mdash;Now you are caught!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. No!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Yes, you are! What you least wanted has happened. The world at
      large, represented by two lady tourists&mdash;whom I had not sent for, as
      I am not an intriguer&mdash;the world has seen how you became reconciled
      to your former husband, and how you sneaked back repentantly into his
      faithful arms. Isn't that enough?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. It ought to be enough for your revenge&mdash;But tell me, how can
      you, who are so enlightened and so right-minded&mdash;how is it possible
      that you, who think whatever happens must happen, and that all our actions
      are determined in advance&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. [Correcting her] To a certain extent determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. That's the same thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. No!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [Disregarding him] How is it possible that you, who hold me
      guiltless, as I was driven by my nature and the circumstances into acting
      as I did&mdash;how can you think yourself entitled to revenge&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. For that very reason&mdash;for the reason that my nature and the
      circumstances drove me into seeking revenge. Isn't that giving both sides
      a square deal? But do you know why you two had to get the worst of it in
      this struggle?
    </p>
    <p>
      (TEKLA looks scornful.)
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. And why you were doomed to be fooled? Because I am stronger than
      you, and wiser also. You have been the idiot&mdash;and he! And now you may
      perceive that a man need not be an idiot because he doesn't write novels
      or paint pictures. It might be well for you to bear this in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Are you then entirely without feelings?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Entirely! And for that very reason, you know, I am capable of
      thinking&mdash;in which you have had no experience whatever-and of acting&mdash;in
      which you have just had some slight experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. And all this merely because I have hurt your vanity?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Don't call that MERELY! You had better not go around hurting other
      people's vanity. They have no more sensitive spot than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Vindictive wretch&mdash;shame on you!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Dissolute wretch&mdash;shame on you!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Oh, that's my character, is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Oh, that's my character, is it?&mdash;You ought to learn something
      about human nature in others before you give your own nature free rein.
      Otherwise you may get hurt, and then there will be wailing and gnashing of
      teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. You can never forgive:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Yes, I have forgiven you!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. You!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Of course! Have I raised a hand against you during all these
      years? No! And now I came here only to have a look at you, and it was
      enough to burst your bubble. Have I uttered a single reproach? Have I
      moralised or preached sermons? No! I played a joke or two on your dear
      consort, and nothing more was needed to finish him.&mdash;But there is no
      reason why I, the complainant, should be defending myself as I am now&mdash;Tekla!
      Have you nothing at all to reproach yourself with?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Nothing at all! Christians say that our actions are governed by
      Providence; others call it Fate; in either case, are we not free from all
      liability?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. In a measure, yes; but there is always a narrow margin left
      unprotected, and there the liability applies in spite of all. And sooner
      or later the creditors make their appearance. Guiltless, but accountable!
      Guiltless in regard to one who is no more; accountable to oneself and
      one's fellow beings.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. So you came here to dun me?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. I came to take back what you had stolen, not what you had received
      as a gift. You had stolen my honour, and I could recover it only by taking
      yours. This, I think, was my right&mdash;or was it not?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Honour? Hm! And now you feel satisfied?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Now I feel satisfied. [Rings for a waiter.]
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. And now you are going home to your fiancee?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. I have no fiancee! Nor am I ever going to have one. I am not going
      home, for I have no home, and don't want one.
    </p>
    <p>
      (A WAITER comes in.)
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Get me my bill&mdash;I am leaving by the eight o'clock boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      (THE WAITER bows and goes out.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Without making up?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Making up? You use such a lot of words that have lost their&mdash;meaning.
      Why should we make up? Perhaps you want all three of us to live together?
      You, if anybody, ought to make up by making good what you took away, but
      this you cannot do. You just took, and what you took you consumed, so that
      there is nothing left to restore.&mdash;Will it satisfy you if I say like
      this: forgive me that you tore my heart to pieces; forgive me that you
      disgraced me; forgive me that you made me the laughing-stock of my pupils
      through every week-day of seven long years; forgive me that I set you free
      from parental restraints, that I released you from the tyranny of
      ignorance and superstition, that I set you to rule my house, that I gave
      you position and friends, that I made a woman out of the child you were
      before? Forgive me as I forgive you!&mdash;Now I have torn up your note!
      Now you can go and settle your account with the other one!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. What have you done with him? I am beginning to suspect&mdash;something
      terrible!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. With him? Do you still love him?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. Yes!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. And a moment ago it was me! Was that also true?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. It was true.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Do you know what you are then?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. You despise me?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. I pity you. It is a trait&mdash;I don't call it a fault&mdash;just
      a trait, which is rendered disadvantageous by its results. Poor Tekla! I
      don't know&mdash;but it seems almost as if I were feeling a certain
      regret, although I am as free from any guilt&mdash;as you! But perhaps it
      will be useful to you to feel what I felt that time.&mdash;Do you know
      where your husband is?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. I think I know now&mdash;he is in that room in there! And he has
      heard everything! And seen everything! And the man who sees his own wraith
      dies!
    </p>
    <p>
      (ADOLPH appears in the doorway leading to the veranda. His face is white
      as a sheet, and there is a bleeding scratch on one cheek. His eyes are
      staring and void of all expression. His lips are covered with froth.)
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. [Shrinking back] No, there he is!&mdash;Now you can settle with
      him and see if he proves as generous as I have been.&mdash;Good-bye!
    </p>
    <p>
      (He goes toward the left, but stops before he reaches the door.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [Goes to meet ADOLPH with open arms] Adolph!
    </p>
    <p>
      (ADOLPH leans against the door-jamb and sinks gradually to the floor.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TEKLA. [Throwing herself upon his prostrate body and caressing him]
      Adolph! My own child! Are you still alive&mdash;oh, speak, speak!&mdash;Please
      forgive your nasty Tekla! Forgive me, forgive me, forgive me!&mdash;Little
      brother must say something, I tell him!&mdash;No, good God, he doesn't
      hear! He is dead! O God in heaven! O my God! Help!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUSTAV. Why, she really must have loved HIM, too!&mdash;Poor creature!

    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Both "Creditors" and "Pariah" were written in the winter of 1888-89 at
      Holte, near Copenhagen, where Strindberg, assisted by his first wife, was
      then engaged in starting what he called a "Scandinavian Experimental
      Theatre." In March, 1889, the two plays were given by students from the
      University of Copenhagen, and with Mrs. von Essen Strindberg as Tekla. A
      couple of weeks later the performance was repeated across the Sound, in
      the Swedish city of Malmo, on which occasion the writer of this
      introduction, then a young actor, assisted in the stage management. One of
      the actors was Gustav Wied, a Danish playwright and novelist, whose
      exquisite art since then has won him European fame. In the audience was
      Ola Hansson, a Swedish novelist and poet who had just published a short
      story from which Strindberg, according to his own acknowledgment on
      playbill and title-page, had taken the name and the theme of "Pariah."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hansson has printed a number of letters (Tilskueren, Copenhagen, July,
      1912) written to him by Strindberg about that time, as well as some very
      informative comments of his own. Concerning the performance of Malmo he
      writes: "It gave me a very unpleasant sensation. What did it mean? Why had
      Strindberg turned my simple theme upsidedown so that it became
      unrecognisable? Not a vestige of the 'theme from Ola Hansson' remained.
      Yet he had even suggested that he and I act the play together, I not
      knowing that it was to be a duel between two criminals. And he had at
      first planned to call it 'Aryan and Pariah'&mdash;which meant, of course,
      that the strong Aryan, Strindberg, was to crush the weak Pariah, Hansson,
      coram populo."
    </p>
    <p>
      In regard to his own story Mr. Hansson informs us that it dealt with "a
      man who commits a forgery and then tells about it, doing both in a sort of
      somnambulistic state whereby everything is left vague and undefined." At
      that moment "Raskolnikov" was in the air, so to speak. And without wanting
      in any way to suggest imitation, I feel sure that the groundnote of the
      story was distinctly Dostoievskian. Strindberg himself had been reading
      Nietzsche and was&mdash;largely under the pressure of a reaction against
      the popular disapproval of his anti-feministic attitude&mdash;being driven
      more and more into a superman philosophy which reached its climax in the
      two novels "Chandalah" (1889) and "At the Edge of the Sea" (1890). The
      Nietzschean note is unmistakable in the two plays contained in the present
      volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these plays are strongly colored by something else&mdash;by something
      that is neither Hansson-Dostoievski nor Strindberg-Nietzsche. The solution
      of the problem is found in the letters published by Mr. Hansson. These
      show that while Strindberg was still planning "Creditors," and before he
      had begun "Pariah," he had borrowed from Hansson a volume of tales by
      Edgar Allan Poe. It was his first acquaintance with the work of Poe,
      though not with American literature&mdash;for among his first printed work
      was a series of translations from American humourists; and not long ago a
      Swedish critic (Gunnar Castren in Samtiden, Christiania, June, 1912) wrote
      of Strindberg's literary beginnings that "he had learned much from Swedish
      literature, but probably more from Mark Twain and Dickens."
    </p>
    <p>
      The impression Poe made on Strindberg was overwhelming. He returns to it
      in one letter after another. Everything that suits his mood of the moment
      is "Poesque" or "E. P-esque." The story that seems to have made the
      deepest impression of all was "The Gold Bug," though his thought seems to
      have distilled more useful material out of certain other stories
      illustrating Poe's theories about mental suggestion. Under the direct
      influence of these theories, Strindberg, according to his own statements
      to Hansson, wrote the powerful one-act play "Simoom," and made Gustav in
      "Creditors" actually CALL FORTH the latent epileptic tendencies in Adolph.
      And on the same authority we must trace the method of: psychological
      detection practised by Mr. X. in "Pariah" directly to "The Gold Bug."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we have the reason why Mr. Hansson could find so little of his story
      in the play. And here we have the origin of a theme which, while not quite
      new to him, was ever afterward to remain a favourite one with Strindberg:
      that of a duel between intellect and cunning. It forms the basis of such
      novels as "Chandalah" and "At the Edge of the Sea," but it recurs in
      subtler form in works of much later date. To readers of the present day,
      Mr. X.&mdash;that striking antithesis of everything a scientist used to
      stand for in poetry&mdash;is much less interesting as a superman in spe
      than as an illustration of what a morally and mentally normal man can do
      with the tools furnished him by our new understanding of human ways and
      human motives. And in giving us a play that holds our interest as firmly
      as the best "love plot" ever devised, although the stage shows us only two
      men engaged in an intellectual wrestling match, Strindberg took another
      great step toward ridding the drama of its old, shackling conventions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of this play has sometimes been translated as "The Outcast,"
      whereby it becomes confused with "The Outlaw," a much earlier play on a
      theme from the old Sagas. I think it better, too, that the Hindu allusion
      in the Swedish title be not lost, for the best of men may become an
      outcast, but the baseness of the Pariah is not supposed to spring only
      from lack of social position.

      SCENE
    </h2>
    <p>
      (A simply furnished room in a farmhouse. The door and the windows in the
      background open on a landscape. In the middle of the room stands a big
      dining-table, covered at one end by books, writing materials, and
      antiquities; at the other end, by a microscope, insect cases, and specimen
      jars full of alchohol.)
    </p>
    <p>
      (On the left side hangs a bookshelf. Otherwise the furniture is that of a
      well-to-do farmer.)
    </p>
    <p>
      (MR. Y. enters in his shirt-sleeves, carrying a butterfly-net and a
      botany-can. He goes straight up to the bookshelf and takes down a book,
      which he begins to read on the spot.)
    </p>
    <p>
      (The landscape outside and the room itself are steeped in sunlight. The
      ringing of church bells indicates that the morning services are just over.
      Now and then the cackling of hens is heard from the outside.)
    </p>
    <p>
      (MR. X. enters, also in his shirt-sleeves.)
    </p>
    <p>
      (MR. Y. starts violently, puts the book back on the shelf upside-down, and
      pretends to be looking for another volume.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. This heat is horrible. I guess we are going to have a thunderstorm.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. What makes you think so?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. The bells have a kind of dry ring to them, the flies are sticky,
      and the hens cackle. I meant to go fishing, but I couldn't find any worms.
      Don't you feel nervous?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. [Cautiously] I?&mdash;A little.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Well, for that matter, you always look as if you were expecting
      thunderstorms.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. [With a start] Do I?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Now, you are going away tomorrow, of course, so it is not to be
      wondered at that you are a little "journey-proud."&mdash;Anything new?&mdash;Oh,
      there's the mail! [Picks up some letters from the table] My, I have
      palpitation of the heart every time I open a letter! Nothing but debts,
      debts, debts! Have you ever had any debts?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. [After some reflection] N-no.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Well, then you don't know what it means to receive a lot of overdue
      bills. [Reads one of the letters] The rent unpaid&mdash;the landlord
      acting nasty&mdash;my wife in despair. And here am I sitting waist-high in
      gold! [He opens an iron-banded box that stands on the table; then both sit
      down at the table, facing each other] Just look&mdash;here I have six
      thousand crowns' worth of gold which I have dug up in the last fortnight.
      This bracelet alone would bring me the three hundred and fifty crowns I
      need. And with all of it I might make a fine career for myself. Then I
      could get the illustrations made for my treatise at once; I could get my
      work printed, and&mdash;I could travel! Why don't I do it, do you suppose?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. I suppose you are afraid to be found out.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. That, too, perhaps. But don't you think an intelligent fellow like
      myself might fix matters so that he was never found out? I am alone all
      the time&mdash;with nobody watching me&mdash;while I am digging out there
      in the fields. It wouldn't be strange if I put something in my own pockets
      now and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. Yes, but the worst danger lies in disposing of the stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Pooh! I'd melt it down, of course&mdash;every bit of it&mdash;and
      then I'd turn it into coins&mdash;with just as much gold in them as
      genuine ones, of course&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. Of course!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Well, you can easily see why. For if I wanted to dabble in
      counterfeits, then I need not go digging for gold first. [Pause] It is a
      strange thing anyhow, that if anybody else did what I cannot make myself
      do, then I'd be willing to acquit him&mdash;but I couldn't possibly acquit
      myself. I might even make a brilliant speech in defence of the thief,
      proving that this gold was res nullius, or nobody's, as it had been
      deposited at a time when property rights did not yet exist; that even
      under existing rights it could belong only to the first finder of it, as
      the ground-owner has never included it in the valuation of his property;
      and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. And probably it would be much easier for you to do this if the&mdash;hm!&mdash;the
      thief had not been prompted by actual need, but by a mania for collecting,
      for instance&mdash;or by scientific aspirations&mdash;by the ambition to
      keep a discovery to himself. Don't you think so?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. You mean that I could not acquit him if actual need had been the
      motive? Yes, for that's the only motive which the law will not accept in
      extenuation. That motive makes a plain theft of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. And this you couldn't excuse?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Oh, excuse&mdash;no, I guess not, as the law wouldn't. On the other
      hand, I must admit that it would be hard for me to charge a collector with
      theft merely because he had appropriated some specimen not yet represented
      in his own collection.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. So that vanity or ambition might excuse what could not be excused
      by need?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. And yet need ought to be the more telling excuse&mdash;the only
      one, in fact? But I feel as I have said. And I can no more change this
      feeling than I can change my own determination not to steal under any
      circumstances whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. And I suppose you count it a great merit that you cannot&mdash;hm!&mdash;steal?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. No, my disinclination to steal is just as irresistible as the
      inclination to do so is irresistible with some people. So it cannot be
      called a merit. I cannot do it, and the other one cannot refrain!&mdash;But
      you understand, of course, that I am not without a desire to own this
      gold. Why don't I take it then? Because I cannot! It's an inability&mdash;and
      the lack of something cannot be called a merit. There!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Closes the box with a slam. Stray clouds have cast their shadows on the
      landscape and darkened the room now and then. Now it grows quite dark as
      when a thunderstorm is approaching.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. How close the air is! I guess the storm is coming all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      [MR. Y. gets up and shuts the door and all the windows.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Are you afraid of thunder?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. It's just as well to be careful.
    </p>
    <p>
      (They resume their seats at the table.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. You're a curious chap! Here you come dropping down like a bomb a
      fortnight ago, introducing yourself as a Swedish-American who is
      collecting flies for a small museum&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. Oh, never mind me now!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. That's what you always say when I grow tired of talking about
      myself and want to turn my attention to you. Perhaps that was the reason
      why I took to you as I did&mdash;because you let me talk about myself? All
      at once we seemed like old friends. There were no angles about you against
      which I could bump myself, no pins that pricked. There was something soft
      about your whole person, and you overflowed with that tact which only
      well-educated people know how to show. You never made a noise when you
      came home late at night or got up early in the morning. You were patient
      in small things, and you gave in whenever a conflict seemed threatening.
      In a word, you proved yourself the perfect companion! But you were
      entirely too compliant not to set me wondering about you in the long run&mdash;and
      you are too timid, too easily frightened. It seems almost as if you were
      made up of two different personalities. Why, as I sit here looking at your
      back in the mirror over there&mdash;it is as if I were looking at somebody
      else.
    </p>
    <p>
      (MR. Y. turns around and stares at the mirror.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. No, you cannot get a glimpse of your own back, man!&mdash;In front
      you appear like a fearless sort of fellow, one meeting his fate with bared
      breast, but from behind&mdash;really, I don't want to be impolite, but&mdash;you
      look as if you were carrying a burden, or as if you were crouching to
      escape a raised stick. And when I look at that red cross your suspenders
      make on your white shirt&mdash;well, it looks to me like some kind of
      emblem, like a trade-mark on a packing-box&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. I feel as if I'd choke&mdash;if the storm doesn't break soon&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. It's coming&mdash;don't you worry!&mdash;And your neck! It looks as
      if there ought to be another kind of face on top of it, a face quite
      different in type from yours. And your ears come so close together behind
      that sometimes I wonder what race you belong to. [A flash of lightning
      lights up the room] Why, it looked as if that might have struck the
      sheriff's house!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. [Alarmed] The sheriff's!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Oh, it just looked that way. But I don't think we'll get much of
      this storm. Sit down now and let us have a talk, as you are going away
      to-morrow. One thing I find strange is that you, with whom I have become
      so intimate in this short time&mdash;that you are one of those whose image
      I cannot call up when I am away from them. When you are not here, and I
      happen to think of you, I always get the vision of another acquaintance&mdash;one
      who does not resemble you, but with whom you have certain traits in
      common.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. Who is he?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. I don't want to name him, but&mdash;I used for several years to
      take my meals at a certain place, and there, at the side-table where they
      kept the whiskey and the otter preliminaries, I met a little blond man,
      with blond, faded eyes. He had a wonderful faculty for making his way
      through a crowd, without jostling anybody or being jostled himself. And
      from his customary place down by the door he seemed perfectly able to
      reach whatever he wanted on a table that stood some six feet away from
      him. He seemed always happy just to be in company. But when he met anybody
      he knew, then the joy of it made him roar with laughter, and he would hug
      and pat the other fellow as if he hadn't seen a human face for years. When
      anybody stepped on his foot, he smiled as if eager to apologise for being
      in the way. For two years I watched him and amused myself by guessing at
      his occupation and character. But I never asked who he was; I didn't want
      to know, you see, for then all the fun would have been spoiled at once.
      That man had just your quality of being indefinite. At different times I
      made him out to be a teacher who had never got his licence, a
      non-commissioned officer, a druggist, a government clerk, a detective&mdash;and
      like you, he looked as if made out of two pieces, for the front of him
      never quite fitted the back. One day I happened to read in a newspaper
      about a big forgery committed by a well-known government official. Then I
      learned that my indefinite gentleman had been a partner of the forger's
      brother, and that his name was Strawman. Later on I learned that the
      aforesaid Strawman used to run a circulating library, but that he was now
      the police reporter of a big daily. How in the world could I hope to
      establish a connection between the forgery, the police, and my little
      man's peculiar manners? It was beyond me; and when I asked a friend
      whether Strawman had ever been punished for something, my friend couldn't
      answer either yes or no&mdash;he just didn't know! [Pause.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. Well, had he ever been&mdash;punished?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. No, he had not. [Pause.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. And that was the reason, you think, why the police had such an
      attraction for him, and why he was so afraid of offending people?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Exactly!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. And did you become acquainted with him afterward?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. No, I didn't want to. [Pause.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. Would you have been willing to make his acquaintance if he had been&mdash;punished?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Perfectly!
    </p>
    <p>
      (MR. Y. rises and walks back and forth several times.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Sit still! Why can't you sit still?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. How did you get your liberal view of human conditions? Are you a
      Christian?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Oh, can't you see that I am not?
    </p>
    <p>
      (MR. Y. makes a face.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. The Christians require forgiveness. But I require punishment in
      order that the balance, or whatever you may call it, be restored. And you,
      who have served a term, ought to know the difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. [Stands motionless and stares at MR. X., first with wild, hateful
      eyes, then with surprise and admiration] How&mdash;could&mdash;you&mdash;know&mdash;that?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Why, I could see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. How? How could you see it?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X, Oh, with a little practice. It is an art, like many others. But
      don't let us talk of it any more. [He looks at his watch, arranges a
      document on the table, dips a pen in the ink-well, and hands it to MR. Y.]
      I must be thinking of my tangled affairs. Won't you please witness my
      signature on this note here? I am going to turn it in to the bank at Malmo
      tomorrow, when I go to the city with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. I am not going by way of Malmo.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Oh, you are not?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. But that need not prevent you from witnessing my signature.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. N-no!&mdash;I never write my name on papers of that kind&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X.&mdash;any longer! This is the fifth time you have refused to write
      your own name. The first time nothing more serious was involved than the
      receipt for a registered letter. Then I began to watch you. And since then
      I have noticed that you have a morbid fear of a pen filled with ink. You
      have not written a single letter since you came here&mdash;only a
      post-card, and that you wrote with a blue pencil. You understand now that
      I have figured out the exact nature of your slip? Furthermore! This is
      something like the seventh time you have refused to come with me to Malmo,
      which place you have not visited at all during all this time. And yet you
      came the whole way from America merely to have a look at Malmo! And every
      morning you walk a couple of miles, up to the old mill, just to get a
      glimpse of the roofs of Malmo in the distance. And when you stand over
      there at the right-hand window and look out through the third pane from
      the bottom on the left side, you can see the spired turrets of the castle
      and the tall chimney of the county jail.&mdash;And now I hope you see that
      it's your own stupidity rather than my cleverness which has made
      everything clear to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. This means that you despise me?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Oh, no!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. Yes, you do&mdash;you cannot but do it!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. No&mdash;here's my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      (MR. Y. takes hold of the outstretched hand and kisses it.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. [Drawing back his hand] Don't lick hands like a dog!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. Pardon me, sir, but you are the first one who has let me touch his
      hand after learning&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. And now you call me "sir!"&mdash;What scares me about you is that
      you don't feel exonerated, washed clean, raised to the old level, as good
      as anybody else, when you have suffered your punishment. Do you care to
      tell me how it happened? Would you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. [Twisting uneasily] Yes, but you won't believe what I say. But I'll
      tell you. Then you can see for yourself that I am no ORDINARY criminal.
      You'll become convinced, I think, that there are errors which, so to
      speak, are involuntary&mdash;[twisting again] which seem to commit
      themselves&mdash;spontaneously&mdash;without being willed by oneself, and
      for which one cannot be held responsible&mdash;May I open the door a
      little now, since the storm seems to have passed over?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Suit yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. [Opens the door; then he sits down at the table and begins to speak
      with exaggerated display of feeling, theatrical gestures, and a good deal
      of false emphasis] Yes, I'll tell you! I was a student in the university
      at Lund, and I needed to get a loan from a bank. I had no pressing debts,
      and my father owned some property&mdash;not a great deal, of course.
      However, I had sent the note to the second man of the two who were to act
      as security, and, contrary to expectations, it came back with a refusal.
      For a while I was completely stunned by the blow, for it was a very
      unpleasant surprise&mdash;most unpleasant! The note was lying in front of
      me on the table, and the letter lay beside it. At first my eyes stared
      hopelessly at those lines that pronounced my doom&mdash;that is, not a
      death-doom, of course, for I could easily find other securities, as many
      as I wanted&mdash;but as I have already said, it was very annoying just
      the same. And as I was sitting there quite unconscious of any evil
      intention, my eyes fastened upon the signature of the letter, which would
      have made my future secure if it had only appeared in the right place. It
      was an unusually well-written signature&mdash;and you know how sometimes
      one may absent-mindedly scribble a sheet of paper full of meaningless
      words. I had a pen in my hand&mdash;[picks up a penholder from the table]
      like this. And somehow it just began to run&mdash;I don't want to claim
      that there was anything mystical&mdash;anything of a spiritualistic nature
      back of it&mdash;for that kind of thing I don't believe in! It was a
      wholly unreasoned, mechanical process&mdash;my copying of that beautiful
      autograph over and over again. When all the clean space on the letter was
      used up, I had learned to reproduce the signature automatically&mdash;and
      then&mdash;[throwing away the penholder with a violent gesture] then I
      forgot all about it. That night I slept long and heavily. And when I woke
      up, I could feel that I had been dreaming, but I couldn't recall the dream
      itself. At times it was as if a door had been thrown ajar, and then I
      seemed to see the writing-table with the note on it as in a distant memory&mdash;and
      when I got out of bed, I was forced up to the table, just as if, after
      careful deliberation, I had formed an irrevocable decision to sign the
      name to that fateful paper. All thought of the consequences, of the risk
      involved, had disappeared&mdash;no hesitation remained&mdash;it was almost
      as if I was fulfilling some sacred duty&mdash;and so I wrote! [Leaps to
      his feet] What could it be? Was it some kind of outside influence, a case
      of mental suggestion, as they call it? But from whom could it come? I was
      sleeping alone in that room. Could it possibly be my primitive self&mdash;the
      savage to whom the keeping of faith is an unknown thing&mdash;which pushed
      to the front while my consciousness was asleep&mdash;together with the
      criminal will of that self, and its inability to calculate the results of
      an action? Tell me, what do you think of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. [As if he had to force the words out of himself] Frankly speaking,
      your story does not convince me&mdash;there are gaps in it, but these may
      depend on your failure to recall all the details&mdash;and I have read
      something about criminal suggestion&mdash;or I think I have, at least&mdash;hm!
      But all that is neither here nor there! You have taken your medicine&mdash;and
      you have had the courage to acknowledge your fault. Now we won't talk of
      it any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. Yes, yes, yes, we must talk of it&mdash;till I become sure of my
      innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Well, are you not?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. No, I am not!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. That's just what bothers me, I tell you. It's exactly what is
      bothering me!&mdash;Don't you feel fairly sure that every human being
      hides a skeleton in his closet? Have we not, all of us, stolen and lied as
      children? Undoubtedly! Well, now there are persons who remain children all
      their lives, so that they cannot control their unlawful desires. Then
      comes the opportunity, and there you have your criminal.&mdash;But I
      cannot understand why you don't feel innocent. If the child is not held
      responsible, why should the criminal be regarded differently? It is the
      more strange because&mdash;well, perhaps I may come to repent it later.
      [Pause] I, for my part, have killed a man, and I have never suffered any
      qualms on account of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. [Very much interested] Have&mdash;you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X, Yes, I, and none else! Perhaps you don't care to shake hands with a
      murderer?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. [Pleasantly] Oh, what nonsense!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Yes, but I have not been punished,
    </p>
    <p>
      ME. Y. [Growing more familiar and taking on a superior tone] So much the
      better for you!&mdash;How did you get out of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. There was nobody to accuse me, no suspicions, no witnesses. This is
      the way it happened. One Christmas I was invited to hunt with a
      fellow-student a little way out of Upsala. He sent a besotted old coachman
      to meet me at the station, and this fellow went to sleep on the box, drove
      the horses into a fence, and upset the whole equipage in a ditch. I am not
      going to pretend that my life was in danger. It was sheer impatience which
      made me hit him across the neck with the edge of my hand&mdash;you know
      the way&mdash;just to wake him up&mdash;and the result was that he never
      woke up at all, but collapsed then and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. [Craftily] And did you report it?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. No, and these were my reasons for not doing so. The man left no
      family behind him, or anybody else to whom his life could be of the
      slightest use. He had already outlived his allotted period of vegetation,
      and his place might just as well be filled by somebody more in need of it.
      On the other hand, my life was necessary to the happiness of my parents
      and myself, and perhaps also to the progress of my science. The outcome
      had once for all cured me of any desire to wake up people in that manner,
      and I didn't care to spoil both my own life and that of my parents for the
      sake of an abstract principle of justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. Oh, that's the way you measure the value of a human life?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. In the present case, yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. But the sense of guilt&mdash;that balance you were speaking of?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. I had no sense of guilt, as I had committed no crime. As a boy I
      had given and taken more than one blow of the same kind, and the fatal
      outcome in this particular case was simply caused by my ignorance of the
      effect such a blow might have on an elderly person.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. Yes, but even the unintentional killing of a man is punished with a
      two-year term at hard labour&mdash;which is exactly what one gets for&mdash;writing
      names.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Oh, you may be sure I have thought of it. And more than one night I
      have dreamt myself in prison. Tell me now&mdash;is it really as bad as
      they say to find oneself behind bolt and bar?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. You bet it is!&mdash;First of all they disfigure you by cutting off
      your hair, and if you don't look like a criminal before, you are sure to
      do so afterward. And when you catch sight of yourself in a mirror you feel
      quite sure that you are a regular bandit.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Isn't it a mask that is being torn off, perhaps? Which wouldn't be
      a bad idea, I should say.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. Yes, you can have your little jest about it!&mdash;And then they
      cut down your food, so that every day and every hour you become conscious
      of the border line between life and death. Every vital function is more or
      less checked. You can feel yourself shrinking. And your soul, which was to
      be cured and improved, is instead put on a starvation diet&mdash;pushed
      back a thousand years into outlived ages. You are not permitted to read
      anything but what was written for the savages who took part in the
      migration of the peoples. You hear of nothing but what will never happen
      in heaven; and what actually does happen on the earth is kept hidden from
      you. You are torn out of your surroundings, reduced from your own class,
      put beneath those who are really beneath yourself. Then you get a sense of
      living in the bronze age. You come to feel as if you were dressed in
      skins, as if you were living in a cave and eating out of a trough&mdash;ugh!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. But there is reason back of all that. One who acts as if he
      belonged to the bronze age might surely be expected to don the proper
      costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. [Irately] Yes, you sneer! You who have behaved like a man from the
      stone age&mdash;and who are permitted to live in the golden age.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. [Sharply, watching him closely] What do you mean with that last
      expression&mdash;the golden age?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. [With a poorly suppressed snarl] Nothing at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Now you lie&mdash;because you are too much of a coward to say all
      you think.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. Am I a coward? You think so? But I was no coward when I dared to
      show myself around here, where I had had to suffer as I did.&mdash;But can
      you tell what makes one suffer most while in there?&mdash;It is that the
      others are not in there too!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. What others?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. Those that go unpunished.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Are you thinking of me?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. But I have committed no crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. Oh, haven't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. No, a misfortune is no crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. So, it's a misfortune to commit murder?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. I have not committed murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. Is it not murder to kill a person?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Not always. The law speaks of murder, manslaughter, killing in
      self-defence&mdash;and it makes a distinction between intentional and
      unintentional killing. However&mdash;now you really frighten me, for it's
      becoming plain to me that you belong to the most dangerous of all human
      groups&mdash;that of the stupid.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. So you imagine that I am stupid? Well, listen&mdash;would you like
      me to show you how clever I am?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Come on!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. I think you'll have to admit that there is both logic and wisdom in
      the argument I'm now going to give you. You have suffered a misfortune
      which might have brought you two years at hard labor. You have completely
      escaped the disgrace of being punished. And here you see before you a man&mdash;who
      has also suffered a misfortune&mdash;the victim of an unconscious impulse&mdash;and
      who has had to stand two years of hard labor for it. Only by some great
      scientific achievement can this man wipe off the taint that has become
      attached to him without any fault of his own&mdash;but in order to arrive
      at some such achievement, he must have money&mdash;a lot of money&mdash;and
      money this minute! Don't you think that the other one, the unpunished one,
      would bring a little better balance into these unequal human conditions if
      he paid a penalty in the form of a fine? Don't you think so?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. [Calmly] Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. Then we understand each other.&mdash;Hm! [Pause] What do you think
      would be reasonable?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Reasonable? The minimum fine in such a case is fixed by the law at
      fifty crowns. But this whole question is settled by the fact that the dead
      man left no relatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. Apparently you don't want to understand. Then I'll have to speak
      plainly: it is to me you must pay that fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. I have never heard that forgers have the right to collect fines
      imposed for manslaughter. And, besides, there is no prosecutor.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. There isn't? Well&mdash;how would I do?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Oh, NOW we are getting the matter cleared up! How much do you want
      for becoming my accomplice?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. Six thousand crowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. That's too much. And where am I to get them?
    </p>
    <p>
      (MR. Y. points to the box.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. No, I don't want to do that. I don't want to become a thief.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. Oh, don't put on any airs now! Do you think I'll believe that you
      haven't helped yourself out of that box before?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. [As if speaking to himself] Think only, that I could let myself be
      fooled so completely. But that's the way with these soft natures. You like
      them, and then it's so easy to believe that they like you. And that's the
      reason why I have always been on my guard against people I take a liking
      to!&mdash;So you are firmly convinced that I have helped myself out of the
      box before?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. Certainly! MR. X. And you are going to report me if you don't get
      six thousand crowns?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. Most decidedly! You can't get out of it, so there's no use trying.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. You think I am going to give my father a thief for son, my wife a
      thief for husband, my children a thief for father, my fellow-workers a
      thief for colleague? No, that will never happen!&mdash;Now I am going over
      to the sheriff to report the killing myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. [Jumps up and begins to pick up his things] Wait a moment!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. For what?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. [Stammering] Oh, I thought&mdash;as I am no longer needed&mdash;it
      wouldn't be necessary for me to stay&mdash;and I might just as well leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. No, you may not!&mdash;Sit down there at the table, where you sat
      before, and we'll have another talk before you go.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. [Sits down after having put on a dark coat] What are you up to now?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. [Looking into the mirror back of MR. Y.] Oh, now I have it! Oh-h-h!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. [Alarmed] What kind of wonderful things are you discovering now?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. I see in the mirror that you are a thief&mdash;a plain, ordinary
      thief! A moment ago, while you had only the white shirt on, I could notice
      that there was something wrong about my book-shelf. I couldn't make out
      just what it was, for I had to listen to you and watch you. But as my
      antipathy increased, my vision became more acute. And now, with your black
      coat to furnish the needed color contrast For the red back of the book,
      which before couldn't be seen against the red of your suspenders&mdash;now
      I see that you have been reading about forgeries in Bernheim's work on
      mental suggestion&mdash;for you turned the book upsidedown in putting it
      back. So even that story of yours was stolen! For tins reason I think
      myself entitled to conclude that your crime must have been prompted by
      need, or by mere love of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. By need! If you only knew&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. If YOU only knew the extent of the need I have had to face and live
      through! But that's another story! Let's proceed with your case. That you
      have been in prison&mdash;I take that for granted. But it happened in
      America, for it was American prison life you described. Another thing may
      also be taken for granted, namely, that you have not borne your punishment
      on this side.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. How can you imagine anything of the kind?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Wait until the sheriff gets here, and you'll learn all about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      (MR. Y. gets up.)
    </p>
    <p>
      ME. X. There you see! The first time I mentioned the sheriff, in
      connection with the storm, you wanted also to run away. And when a person
      has served out his time he doesn't care to visit an old mill every day
      just to look at a prison, or to stand by the window&mdash;in a word, you
      are at once punished and unpunished. And that's why it was so hard to make
      you out. [Pause.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. [Completely beaten] May I go now?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Now you can go.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. [Putting his things together] Are you angry at me?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Yes&mdash;would you prefer me to pity you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. [Sulkily] Pity? Do you think you're any better than I?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Of course I do, as I AM better than you. I am wiser, and I am less
      of a menace to prevailing property rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. You think you are clever, but perhaps I am as clever as you. For
      the moment you have me checked, but in the next move I can mate you&mdash;all
      the same!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. [Looking hard at MR. Y.] So we have to have another bout! What kind
      of mischief are you up to now?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. That's my secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Just look at me&mdash;oh, you mean to write my wife an anonymous
      letter giving away MY secret!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. Well, how are you going to prevent it? You don't dare to have me
      arrested. So you'll have to let me go. And when I am gone, I can do what I
      please.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. You devil! So you have found my vulnerable spot! Do you want to
      make a real murderer out of me?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. That's more than you'll ever become&mdash;coward!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. There you see how different people are. You have a feeling that I
      cannot become guilty of the same kind of acts as you. And that gives you
      the upper hand. But suppose you forced me to treat you as I treated that
      coachman?
    </p>
    <p>
      [He lifts his hand as if ready to hit MR. Y.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. [Staring MR. X. straight in the face] You can't! It's too much for
      one who couldn't save himself by means of the box over there.
    </p>
    <p>
      ME. X. So you don't think I have taken anything out of the box?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. You were too cowardly&mdash;just as you were too cowardly to tell
      your wife that she had married a murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. You are a different man from what I took you to be&mdash;if
      stronger or weaker, I cannot tell&mdash;if more criminal or less, that's
      none of my concern&mdash;but decidedly more stupid; that much is quite
      plain. For stupid you were when you wrote another person's name instead of
      begging&mdash;as I have had to do. Stupid you were when you stole things
      out of my book&mdash;could you not guess that I might have read my own
      books? Stupid you were when you thought yourself cleverer than me, and
      when you thought that I could be lured into becoming a thief. Stupid you
      were when you thought balance could be restored by giving the world two
      thieves instead of one. But most stupid of all you were when you thought I
      had failed to provide a safe corner-stone for my happiness. Go ahead and
      write my wife as many anonymous letters as you please about her husband
      having killed a man&mdash;she knew that long before we were married!&mdash;Have
      you had enough now?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Y. May I go?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. X. Now you HAVE to go! And at once! I'll send your things after you!&mdash;Get
      out of here!
    </p>
    <p>
      (Curtain.)

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
